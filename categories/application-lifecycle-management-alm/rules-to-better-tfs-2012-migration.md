<p>​Upgrading Team Foundation Server can be a daunting task. Be assured that things have become easier and if you follow this guide, it will minimize your downtime.</p>
<p>In this page we will look at upgrading an existing TFS 2010 server to a new TFS 2012 server. In this walkthrough, we assume you are currently using a single server configuration, but might want to separate your SQL Server from your TFS server.&#160;We also assume you have a DNS entry setup for external access at tfs.northwind.com. </p>
