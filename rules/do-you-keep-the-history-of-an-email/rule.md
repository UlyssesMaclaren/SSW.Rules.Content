<span class='intro'> 
  <p>Often I receive a reply to an email I sent and it has one word - &quot;Yes.&quot; I can't remember what I asked for and the respondent has deleted the history, so I don't know what's going on. I can't check to see whether they have answered all my questions, or what the URL was in the original email, and I can't CC someone else on my reply because the email is missing half the information. So I have to go back into my sent items, find what I asked for and copy and paste it into my reply. </p>
<p>Crazy. Just don't delete the history! Geezzzzeeeee, surely we aren't that hard up for disk space.</p>
