<span class='intro'> <p>
                    An oversized image or table on your page can greatly reduce your page's readability
                    and disrupt its layout￼￼￼￼. It affects page loading and can also cause problems in printing, wasting natural resources.</p> </span>

<p> That's why you should limit all your images and tables to a maximum of 8​00 pixels wide.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-YellowBorderBox"> We have a program called 
   <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/" target="_blank">SSW Code Auditor</a> to check for this rule.</p><p> Some have said 800 pixels is too small, if you resized a large image you can't read the text - we think if you have an image that is large, then there must be reasons.</p><ol><li>If we are trying to show an overall layout, then it is OK for the text to be too small to see.</li><li>If we are trying to show specific details - either a feature or a problem, then it is OK to crop the image so that they fit the size.</li></ol><p> Also, if you are resizing in Photoshop you can easily resize the image and yet put the zoom out on a part that you want the reader to read (combining both options).</p>​
