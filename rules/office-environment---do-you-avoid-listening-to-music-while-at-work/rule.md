I love my iPod, but should we be using them                     at work? Is there a way to use them effectively at work? I've had the "music debate"                     with numerous people about using personal music in the workplace.
 
Regardless of whether it is AC/DC or DotNetRocks, music/podcasts should not be used in the work place because:

- I want my team to work with each other, and I don't mind that they hear other conversations<br>                        going on. Hopefully if they hear about a problem they can fix quickly, they'll help<br>                        each other out. Let me give you an example... say Andrew (who is busy working on<br>                        another project) overhears Marlon say "Cool I found this great code generator, but<br>                        I can't get past this error". I want Andrew to be able to quickly offer up advice<br>                        (assuming he knows the answer already) to fix Marlon's problem before an issue develops.<br>                        In this case he would say "Hey we don't use that code generator, you need to use<br>                        [SSW's standard code generator](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/DeveloperGeneral/netTools.aspx)"<br>
- It's been suggested that [multi-tasking lowers your ability to efficiently<br>                        carry out a task](http&#58;//www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/09/the-multi-tasking-myth.html) (e.g. doing your task at hand along with listening to tunes)<br>                        - by as much as 20%!
- It can be anti-social - some people can shelter themselves
- It regularly leads to "oh, I love this song, you should hear it" which subsequently<br>                        turns into a bigger distraction from work for multiple people


Others have said I am wrong with reasons like:

- "It helps me give you 100% - since the office is noisy I can concentrate and I need<br>                        to block out a noisy environment".<br>                        
<br>                        Isn't the music just creating an additional noise source?
- "It helps me relax".<br>                        
<br>                        Yes I love hearing a good song, for example, when I hear Robbie Williams' "Better<br>                        man" it gets me pumped a bit and I guess it has a positive effect on a my state<br>                        of mind. I am unconvinced it helps me program better.


There is, however, a use for it being "background" music in some scenarios; like                     when you are doing time consuming mindless stuff like fixing data, building VPCs/VMWares                     or waiting for long builds.

I've also been into a few offices that use ambient music to subdue their employees.                     Again, I'm not convinced of this as a method mostly due to the fact that you're not                     likely to be able to attend to everyone's tastes, and you're even more likely to                     intensify the "oh, I love this song" factor.â€‹
