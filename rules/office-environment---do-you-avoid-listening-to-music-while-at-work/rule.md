Should we be listening to music                    at work? I've had the debate with numerous people.
 
Regardless of whether it is AC/DC or DotNetRocks, music/podcasts should not be used in the work place because:

- I want my team to work with each other, and I don't mind that they hear other conversations<br>                        going on. Hopefully if they hear about a problem they can fix quickly, they'll help<br>                        each other out.
- It's been suggested that [multi-tasking lowers your ability to efficiently<br>                        carry out a task](http&#58;//www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/09/the-multi-tasking-myth.html) (e.g. doing your task at hand along with listening to tunes)<br>                        - by as much as 20%!
- It can be anti-social - some people can shelter themselves
- It regularly leads to "oh, I love this song, you should hear it" which subsequently<br>                        turns into a bigger distraction from work for multiple people


Others have said I am wrong with reasons like:

- "It helps me give you 100% - since the office is noisy I can concentrate and I need<br>                        to block out a noisy environment".<br>​                        
<br>                        Isn't the music just creating an additional noise source?
- "It helps me relax".<br>                        
<br>                        Yes I love hearing a good song, for example, when I hear Robbie Williams' "Better<br>                        man" it gets me pumped a bit and I guess it has a positive effect on a my state<br>                        of mind. I am unconvinced it helps me program better.


There is, however, a use for it being "background" music in some scenarios; like                     when you are doing time consuming mindless stuff like fixing data, building VPCs/VMWares                     or waiting for long builds.

Note: Please see our [Rules To Better<br>                        Dead Time](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterDeadTime.aspx#AudioDevice) for how we like to effectively use audio devices like iPods when we're not at work.
