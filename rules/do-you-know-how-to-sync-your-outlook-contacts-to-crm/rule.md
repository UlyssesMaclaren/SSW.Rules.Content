It can be useful to have the contacts you deal with regulary in your outlook (for           offline access and easy editing).
 
Contacts that you create or have tranferred to you and tagged as your "Active contacts".           These are the only ones that will sync from CRM to your Outlook. In Outlook, you           can choose which of your personal contacts you want to sync to CRM by using the           toolbar option "track in CRM" and "Set Parent" (i.e. company).

To do this, in Outlook, click CRM | Options | Synchronization, and click Contacts.

          <dd>Figure&#58; Contact Synchronization enabled</dd>
        </dl>
Remember, if your Outlook syncs to your mobile device, and you have a very large           number of active contacts under your name, often it is not a scalable option to sync           to CRM as you may get too many contacts to easily deal with.
