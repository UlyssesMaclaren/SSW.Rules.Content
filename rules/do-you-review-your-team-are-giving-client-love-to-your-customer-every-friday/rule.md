​Developers should carry out "Client Love" every week.

There are a few ways to achieve this...
 
1. From an overall team perspective, you can check in with the Scrum Master about how the Scrum Retrospective meetings are going. You can see an overview in the [Review/Retro email](/do-you-create-a-sprint-review-retro-email).
2. From an individual developer perspective, you can check their time sheets on Friday to look for extra initiative shown.​
