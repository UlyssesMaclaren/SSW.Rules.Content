<span class='intro'> In Microsoft Outlook you have the option to use Word as your Email editor.  </span>

<h2><a name="UseWORDAsEditor"></a>&#160;</h2><span class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea"><img style="border-bottom&#58;1px solid;border-left&#58;1px solid;border-top&#58;1px solid;border-right&#58;1px solid;" border="1" alt="Outlook Word As Editor" src="/Standards/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/OutlookWordAsEditor.gif" /> </span><span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Make sure you have this check box on</span> 
<p>This has a few advantages&#58;</p>
<ol>
<li>It automatically compresses images which you paste into your email (meaning a much smaller size email) 
<li>You get all the benefits of Word eg. Formatting and styles, spell checking smart tags, thesaurus - the list goes on and on. 
<li>With the emergence of some great 3rd Party Smart Tags you can integrate your database in your email program. Companies often forget that improving their&#160;users' ability to handle email efficiently can be one of the biggest productivity gains you can achieve. </li></ol><span class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea"><img style="border-bottom&#58;1px solid;border-left&#58;1px solid;border-top&#58;1px solid;border-right&#58;1px solid;" border="1" alt="Outlook Using Word As My Editor" src="/Standards/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/OutlookUsingWordAsMyEditor.gif" /> </span><span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; See the difference in size</span>
