 The role of the [Story Owner](/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx) is like a mini project manager. The Story Owner resolves any road blocks, performs the “[Test Please](/Pages/TestPleaseInScrum.aspx)” and makes sure there is a good presentation at the Review Meeting. In addition having a Story Owner makes it easy for Product Owners and others to talk to the right person. <br> 
There are five things that the story owner is responsible for:

- Manage / Own the story and its sub tasks
- Make sure a “[Test Please](/Pages/TestPleaseInScrum.aspx)” is conducted (or that their story is included in one)
- Make every effort to show the story to the Product Owner before the Sprint Review (aka a [corridor conversation](/spec-do-you-conduct-a-specification-review-%28ask-for-a-coffee-not-a-marriage%29))
- Prepare for the Sprint Review. Make sure he ready for the review. Have a scribe, have a demo plan/script and get the story accepted quickly.
- Present the completed Story at the Sprint Review


Note: Make sure you are ready for the review. Have a scribe and how you are demoing worked out before hand.

The objective of the Review meeting is to have the story accepted quickly.
