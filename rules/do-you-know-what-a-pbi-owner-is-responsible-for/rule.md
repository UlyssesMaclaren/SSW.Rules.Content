 The role of the [Story Owner](/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx) is like a mini project manager. They notify their team members when they are able to start tasks to ensure critical paths between tasks are identified and they conduct a “[Test Please](/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/TestPleaseInScrum.aspx)” in order to make sure that what is delivered to the Product Owner and is part of the potentially shippable unit of work delivered by the Sprint. <br> 
At the review meeting they present their Owned stories and need to identify the computer they will use to demonstrate the story.

- Manage / Own the story and its sub tasks
- Make sure a “[Test Please](/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/TestPleaseInScrum.aspx)” is conducted or that their story is included in one
- Make every effort to show the story to the Product Owner before the Sprint Review
- Present the completed Story at the Sprint Review
<br>    Note: Make sure you are ready for the review. Have a scribe and how you are demoing worked out before hand.


The objective of the Review meeting is to have the story accepted quickly.
