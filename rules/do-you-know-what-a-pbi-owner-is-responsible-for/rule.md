 The role of the [Story Owner](/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx) is like a mini project manager. The Story Owner resolves any road blocks, performs the “[Test Please](/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/TestPleaseInScrum.aspx)” and makes sure there is a good presentation at the Review Meeting. 

<br>There are four things that the story owner is responsible for: <br> 
- Manage / Own the story and its sub tasks
- Make sure a “[Test Please](/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/TestPleaseInScrum.aspx)” is conducted or that their story is included in one
- Make every effort to show the story to the Product Owner before the Sprint Review
- Present the completed Story at the Sprint Review
<br>    Note: Make sure you are ready for the review. Have a scribe and how you are demoing worked out before hand.


The objective of the Review meeting is to have the story accepted quickly.
