 When a client arrives, your job is to make them feel comfortable and impress them with your professionalism. It is important that clients have a consistent experience in their contact with your company. â€‹
 
- Leaving the client standing at the reception while finishing what you were doing
- Offering them tea, coffee or biscuits (not everyone likes tea/coffee)

Figure: Bad example - This could start the meeting poorly

- Be dressed appropriately
- Greet them warmly
- Have a firm handshake
- Make eye contact and smile
- Direct them to wait in the boardroom (so they can see all the marketing materials on the walls)
- Notify the project manager/developers who are included in the meeting
- Ask someone to bring couple of glasses of water into the meeting (as everyone drinks water) Join the meeting in the boardroom:
    - Show some enthusiasm when meeting with the client
    - Hand over, and collect, business cards - (organize in front of you, to help you remember their names)
    - Use their names a few times early on to help you remember their name

Figure: Good Example - You are starting off the meeting well
