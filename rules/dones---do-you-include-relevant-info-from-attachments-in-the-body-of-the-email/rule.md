<span class='intro'> When someone sends you a .doc file or images that are attached, when you reply done they (and others CCed) won't be able to see the appropriate history. If it is a word .doc or an image; open it and&#160;copy and paste the text/image into the footer. Don't leave it as an attachment.
<div><br>
</div>
<div>If you think you&#160;should not reply to the latest email in the thread, then you need to include one line which says &quot;Fixed history to put back images - caused by Adam's iPhone&quot;, making others understand clearly that you removed a conversation and replying in relation to that conversation.</div>
