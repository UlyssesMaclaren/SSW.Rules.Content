 When someone sends you a .doc file or images that are attached, when you reply done they (and others CCed) won't be able to see the appropriate history. If it is a word .doc or an image; open it and copy and paste the text/image into the footer. Don't leave it as an attachment.<br>



If you think you should not reply to the latest email in the thread, then you need to include one line which says "Fixed history to put back images - caused by Adam's iPhone", making others understand clearly that you removed a conversation and replying in relation to that conversation.
