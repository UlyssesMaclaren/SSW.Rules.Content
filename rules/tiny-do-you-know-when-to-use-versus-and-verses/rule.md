​​​​​Words like “verses” and “versus” are homophones, meaning they are pronounced the same, but have different spellings and different meanings.

When using a homophone in a sentence, it is important to ensure you are using the correct word, as if you are not, it won’t be picked up by your spell check and you'll look less intelligent.
   ​In this case, “verses” refers to lines of poetry or bible passages. “Versus” refers to 2 or more parties in opposition to one another, especially in sports or legal situations.



“Versus” can be shortened to “vs.”, which is common in<br>sporting situations, or “v.”, which is the standard abbreviation for legal<br>scenarios.  





"Matthew 5:41 is one of my favourite bible versus."
Figure: Bad example: the wrong “versus” is used



"Floyd verses Mayweather."
Figure: Bad example: Floyd did not poetry<br>Mayweather 

"Brown v. The Board of Education."
Figure: Good example: in a legal context, “versus”<br>is abbreviated to “v.”


"Adam penned many verses about his lo​ve for .NET development"
Figure: Good example​
