 Avoid monolithic Product Backlog Items (PBIs). Ideally all PBIs should be less than 2 days. If you are given a feature that is going to take weeks, then split it following this rule. 
 Subject: Create a MVC prototype with web services Figure: Bad example – This is a monolithic 4 day task Email #1 Subject:  MVC prototype - Create a web page with firstname and lastname textboxes, a save button (and remmed out code to later call a web service)

Email #2 Subject:  MVC prototype - Create a table for customer with firstname and lastname and any other fields required for this table

Email #3 Subject:  MVC prototype - Create a web service with the customer CRUD methods
Silverlight prototype - with firstname and lastname textboxes, a save button (and remmed out code web service)​

Email #4 Subject:  MVC prototype - Create methods on webservice exposed to client
MVC prototype - with firstname and lastname textboxes, a save Figure: Good example – The same monolithic task, broken down into 4 smaller tasks
