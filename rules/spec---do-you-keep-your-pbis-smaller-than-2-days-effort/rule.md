 Avoid monolithic tasks. Ideally all tasks should be less than 4 hours. If you are given a task that is going to take days, then split it following this rule.  Subject: Create a Silverlight prototype with web services Figure: Bad example – This is a monolithic 2 day task Email #1 Subject:  Silverlight prototype - Create a web page with firstname and lastname textboxes, a save button (and remmed out code to later call a web service)

Email #2 Subject:  Silverlight prototype - Create a table for customer with firstname and lastname and any other fields required for this table

Email #3 Subject:  Silverlight prototype - Create a web service with the customer CRUD methods
Silverlight prototype - with firstname and lastname textboxes, a save button (and remmed out code web service 

Email #4 Subject:  Silverlight prototype - Create methods on webservice exposed to client
Silverlight prototype - with firstname and lastname textboxes, a save button (and remmed out code web serviceFigure: Good example – The same monolithic task, broken down into 4 smaller tasks
