 Looking manually through your Outlook sent items is plain donkey work, that you should not be doing. The better way is: On Windows XP and Office 2003 use the Windows Desktop Search (or Google Desktop Search). On Vista and Office 2007 it is all built in.

Let's use an example; say you are looking for emails sent to Frank where they have sql auditor and link auditor in the email (subject or body) then you enter "sent items" to:Frank "sql auditor" in search box; then you get the list of sql auditor emails sent to Frank.

If using Microsoft Outlook 2007, then use the search option to find your sent items.Â

We can also use Exchange Reporter to see the number of emails sent by each users.
