 In a similar fashion to the [Do you remind yourself to do a demo?](/Pages/DemoSlide.aspx) rule, you can also add a visual cue for any audience participation you would like, such as questions or voting.  <dl>    <dt><img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" src="SSWQuestionMark.gif" alt=""> </dt>
    <dd class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure: Use an "?" image to tell the presenter to ask a question (if you don't have an image - just use the "?" text) </dd></dl>
