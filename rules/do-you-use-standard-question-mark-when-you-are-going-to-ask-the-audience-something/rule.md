 In a similar fashion to the [Do you remind yourself to do a demo?](/Communication/RulesToBetterPowerpointPresentations/Pages/DemoSlide.aspx) rule, you can also add a visual cue for any audience participation you would like, such as questions or voting.  <dl>    <dt><img alt="" class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" src="/Communication/RulesToBetterPowerpointPresentations/PublishingImages/SSWQuestionMark.gif"> </dt>
    <dd class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Use an &quot;?&quot; image to tell the presenter to ask a question (if you don't have an image - just use the &quot;?&quot; text) </dd></dl>
