Some font are easier to read then others, at SSW we follow Microsoft's [Visual Design Guidelines](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/Microsoft/MSDNInterfaceText.htm). This means we use Tahoma 8pt as our font of choice.
   â€‹
At SSW, we use Code Auditor to ensure all fonts on our forms are set to Tahoma but we allow controls to use a different font. This is because certain information is better displayed in a different font. For example a Textbox to show code should use Courier instead of Tahoma.

| We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Rules.aspx#VBFont) to check for this rule. |
