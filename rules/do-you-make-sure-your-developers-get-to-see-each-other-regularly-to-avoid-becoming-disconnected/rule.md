 Working onsite has a number of benefits such as increased communication with the client and increased perception of value. However, if a developer is onsite for an extended period, they can start to feel disconnected from your company and their co-workers​.
​

 
​The solution is to bring them back to the office 1-2 days a week to reconnect with everyone and still feel like they're part of a larger organization.

This should be organized​ up front with the client when making the booking.​
