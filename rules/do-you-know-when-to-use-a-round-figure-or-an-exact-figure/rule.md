 The number you give to a client says a lot about how much room there is to move. Knowing the difference and when to use them can be a valuable tool in securing projects.


For a     **fixed price **project, exact figures should be used. This makes sure there is no ambiguity between what the client is thinking and what you are thinking.

A round figure gives the impression that it was just plucked out of thin air and you can go lower.
The project will take about 6 months to complete and cost $200,000+GST
Bad Example - You've just made that number up, you can go lower​
An exact figure gives the impression that you've done your research and there isn't as much room to move.
The project will take 6 months to complete and cost $204,080+GST
Good Example - Everyone knows exactly what they're in for
 
For a** variable price **project, round figures should be used. This gives room for the project scope to be varied with additional items and lends itself more to an agile approach.
The project will take ​6 months to complete and cost $204,080+GST
Bad Example - This makes it very hard to vary the project as the client will always have this figure in mind
 
 A round figure gives the impression that this is a ball park estimate and that the price will likely change. 
The project will take about 6 months to complete and cost $200,000+GST
Good Example - Give the client an indication of how much it will approximately cost without committing to the figure
