At the end of every Sprint the Development Team performs a Sprint Retrospective also known as the Retro. The Retro provides an opportunity for the Scrum Team to reflect on what has gone well, what has gone poorly, and what the team wants to change.

Inspect-and-adapt is a key component of the Scrum framework and the Retro gives Scrum Teams an opportunity to learn from their successes and mistakes.

The Retro is a time-boxed event that focuses around 3 questions:


- What went well?
- What didn't go well?
- What will we do differently in the next Sprint?





The Scrum Master facilitates the meeting and collects issues as they are raised. Once every Scrum Team Member has spoken he facilitates debate on each issue so that team consensus is achieved.  The result should produce an actionable outcome, for example:

- An adjustment is made to the daily processes followed by the Scrum Team
- An adjustment is made to the Definition of Done
- An adjustment is made at the organisation level
- An item is added to the Product Backlog


To help aid discussion it can be useful for the Scrum Master to prepare items for review by inspecting the Sprint Backlog and statistics such as Code Coverage. For example the Scrum Master can find User Stories that were successful / not successful and then facilitate the discussion as to why.

Once all issues have been discussed to the satisfaction of The Scrum Team, the meeting concludes.

 If the timebox limit is reached, the remaining issues should be recorded and dealt with by the Scrum Master.  Any outstanding issues must be raised at the next Retrospective if they are still relevant.

 The time-box for this meeting is usually as many hours as weeks in the Sprint.

In Scrum, there are totally 4 meetings that you need to know:
- Sprint Planning Meeting (we separate this meeting to two parts: [WHAT](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/SprintPlanning%28WHAT%29Meeting.aspx "Sprint Planning (WHAT) Meeting") and [HOW](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/SprintPlanning%28HOW%29Meeting.aspx))
- [Scrum Meeting (Daily standup)](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/DailyScrumUpdateTasks.aspx "Update tasks before Daily Scrum Meeting")
- [Sprint Review Meeting](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/SprintReviewMeeting.aspx "Sprint Review Meeting")
- Sprint Retrospective Meeting
