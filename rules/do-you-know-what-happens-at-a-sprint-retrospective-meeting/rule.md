This is when The Scrum Team decides how they can improve and take action to do so.
  The ScrumMaster asks each member of The Scrum Team in turn what they found good about the Sprint.

 After focusing on the good aspect the ScrumMaster asks each member of The Scrum Team in turn what they would like improved about the Sprint.  Some discussion should be allowed for clarification purposes but once an issue is raised and understood the next person should then get their turn.

 The ScrumMaster collects the issues as they are raised and, once every Scrum Team Member has spoken, then facilitates debate on each issue, in some priority order, so that team consensus is achieved.  The result should usually be one of the following:

- An adjustment is made to the daily processes followed by the Scrum Team and is recorded as a Team Practice
- An adjustment is made to the Done critera
- An adjustment is made at the organisation level and recorded as a new SSW Rule
- An item is added to the Product Backlog
- No action


Once all issues have been discussed to the satisfaction of The Scrum Team, the meeting concludes.

 If the timebox limit is reached, the remaining issues should be recorded and dealt with by the Scrum Master.  Any outstanding issues must raised at the next Retrospective if still relevant.

 The timebox for this meeting is usually as many hours as weeks in the Sprint.

In Scrum, there are totally 4 meetings that you need to know:
- Sprint Planning Meeting (we separate this meeting to two parts: [WHAT](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/SprintPlanning%28WHAT%29Meeting.aspx "Sprint Planning (WHAT) Meeting") and [HOW](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/SprintPlanning%28HOW%29Meeting.aspx))
- [Scrum Meeting (Daily standup)](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/DailyScrumUpdateTasks.aspx "Update tasks before Daily Scrum Meeting")
- [Sprint Review Meeting](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/SprintReviewMeeting.aspx "Sprint Review Meeting")
- Sprint Retrospective Meeting
