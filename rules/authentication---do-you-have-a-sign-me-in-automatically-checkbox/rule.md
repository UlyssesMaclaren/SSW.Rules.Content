When you present visitors to your site with an opportunity to sign in, you should                     always include an option to have that person signed in automatically.
 ![Sign In Automatically](/WebSites/RulesToBetterWebsitesLayout/PublishingImages/signin.jpg) Figure: 'Sâ€‹tay signed in' checkbox is available
This should be implemented simply by using a check box. A cookie should be stored on the user's computer so that next time they visit your site the sign in process is automatic.
