​​When explaining steps in a process, e.g. Printing a file, make sure to say something "will" happen or is happening. This is especially important when describing your own software, because saying something "should" happen implies that it may or may not happen, i.e. there could be bugs!
 
​To print your document:
1.    Select File | Print. The Print dialog should now show.
2.    Select the number of copies and click Print. The file should now print.

To print your document:

2.    Select the number of copies and click Print. The file will now print.​
Good example - Using present or future tense implies confidence
