 It is easy to think that 'content is king', that is a well known quote. But Rupert Murdoch said it better "factual content is king" so: 
<br>\* Fix up your mistakes, and 
<br>\* Strike through content that is now been superseded and put a comment eg. "This is now not an issue as it was fixed up in TFS SP1"<br>
