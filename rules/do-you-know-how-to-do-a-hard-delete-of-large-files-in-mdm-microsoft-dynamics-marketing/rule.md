<span class='intro'> <p>MDM doesn’t do a hard delete, so if you try to delete a 2GB file, the space will still be being used up, sitting on your precious (and limited) online storage space.</p> </span>

<p>​<span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">Example&#58; you have a large 2GB piece of video marketing media that you accidentally copy 3 times. Instead of being able to delete it, all you can actually do is deactivate it, so it will still be taking up space.</span></p><p class="p1">​The solution is to overwrite with a tiny file first, then delete. It will still be sitting on the server, but only taking up the much smaller amount of space.</p>
