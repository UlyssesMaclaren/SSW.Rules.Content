​If you are active in a forum, like the MSDN or Stackoverflow forums, then you should set up the RSS for your activity to automatically tweet.

Maybe your followers will want to chip in with a better answer. 

 This is done by finding your "activity" feed on the forum:


> Activity feed from for Microsoft 
>  http://services.social.microsoft.com/Feeds/Acti​viti​es?user=MrHinsh&lcid=en-US&bran​d=Msdn&format=rss20
> 
> Activity feed from StackOverflow
