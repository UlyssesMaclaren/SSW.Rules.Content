Try to never discount your price. Instead, you should be adding value                     to the offering for the client.
 
If a client asks for a discount, try to add value by offering something else.

e.g.​

- Some of your products at no charge​
- A Senior Consultant for 2 hours a<br>                        month to complete the following tasks:
    - Code Review
    - UI Review
