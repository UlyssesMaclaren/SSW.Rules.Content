​Electronic communication can easily cause misunderstandings. Help the reader understand your message better by:

- Keeping the prior email in your reply
- When quoting text from someone else (eg. The original email you are replying to, a web page, etc.), use the “&gt;” and indentation. Your new text should be kept to the left. When quoting text on web pages, always include a link to the web page.
- Add numbers if the sender didn't
- Use a different text color in your reply


This way you won't forget any questions in the original email.

​Also remember that when [changing X to Y](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=172019d0-82fc-4d7b-9d91-ded321714309), X should be indented with "&gt;" (because it comes from someone else), and Y should be kept to the left (because it comes from you).

Please change from X to Y
The program flow logic worries me a bit

**Note: **For those using mobile devices the indentation function is not available, try instead using 3 spaces to indent manually​.
