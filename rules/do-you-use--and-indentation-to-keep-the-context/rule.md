​Electronic communication can easily cause misunderstandings. Help the reader understand your message better by:

- Keeping the prior email in your reply
- Quote the original email by using the "&gt;" and indentation. Your new text should be kept to the left. When quoting text on web pages, other people or quoting past email history, indent it
- Add numbers if the sender didn't
- Use a different text ​colour in your reply


This way you won't forget any questions in the original email.

Please change from X to Y
The program flow logic worries me a bit 
Done. Sorry, this wasn't a final decision - I just put it there for testing purposes
​ Figure: Bad Example - there's too much information here
