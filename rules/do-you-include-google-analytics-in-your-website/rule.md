 ​​Google Analytics gives you a great insight into how, when and where your website is used. 
​

If you're not using an analytics package in your website, you're flying blind when it comes to understanding how, when and where your website is used.

To add Google Analytics to your website, first log into your Google account at [https://www.google.com/analytics](https&#58;//www.google.com/analytics). Go to Admin, ensure both Account and Property specify your website, then go to Tracking Info | Tracking Code.

Once deployed, this script will start tracking metrics and interacting with Google Analytics.

Google Analytics tracks lots of metrics in your website​ but one of the most useful is the breakdown of visits by each browser (IE, Chome etc).
