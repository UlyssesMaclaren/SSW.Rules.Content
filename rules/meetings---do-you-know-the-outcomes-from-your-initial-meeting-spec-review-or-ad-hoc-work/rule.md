<span class='intro'> <h4>Schedule a Specification Review</h4>

                <p>
                    For almost all projects, there is a need for additional requirements gathering.
                    Some clients don't have any kind of specification, while the specifications you&#160;are
                    given can sometimes be&#160;lacking in detail or incomplete. Accordingly, before you&#160;can
                    provide an estimated&#160;price for completing the project, there is a another step which
                    requires engagement of your&#160;resources - the <a href="/Management/RulestoBetterSpecificationReviews/Pages/Default.aspx">Specification Review</a>.
                </p> </span>

<p> It is the responsibility of the Account Manager during the initial meeting to present the benefits of a Specification Review for the client. Following the initial meeting, the Account Manager will send a 
   <a href="/Management/Rules-To-Better-Software-Consultants-Dealing-With-Clients/Pages/BriefProposalOrSpecificationReview.aspx" target="_blank">brief proposal</a> 
    in the form of a <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/templates/BriefProposalPostInitialMeeting.doc">Post initial meeting</a> email through to the prospective client for a Specification Review.&#160;</p><p>It may be necessary to conduct a second initial meeting with a technical specialist attending as well.&#160;</p><p><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">You may also find that some clients are unable to progress to a Spec Review until they have a vague ballpark. In these cases,&#160;</span><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">the sales person is to make the decision whether an extra 4 hours will be spent investigating the solution before the </span><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">ballpark is </span><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">given.</span></p><p>A sales person has 16 hours per month of developer time they can invest into this pre-sales investigation, so this time has to be used wisely.</p><p>Never offer a fixed price at the conclusion of an Initial Meeting, and this engagement model must be chosen before&#160;the Specification Review is done. </p><p> More on the

Normal standards for work should be followed, such as 
   <a href="/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/DailyStandUpScrum.aspx">daily scrums</a>. This type of work is called 'ad-hoc' work. </p><p> You&#160;may also immediately commence ad-hoc work if the client is a technical client and you&#160;are​ providing resources for an existing project under the sole direction of the client.​​ </p>
