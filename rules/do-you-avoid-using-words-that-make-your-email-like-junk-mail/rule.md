<br>Outlook by default reads your emails and can flag your email as potential junk email, or adult content email by examining a list of bad words. [Microsoft list of words](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/Microsoft/OutlookBadWords.htm).

Sometimes, you would want to avoid using swear words, or using an angry tone as well.

We have a program called [SSW LookOut! for Outlook](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/LookOut/) to check for this rule.
