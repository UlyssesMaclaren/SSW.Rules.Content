When we configure networks we give all computers in the company a naming theme like Buildings, Cars, Countries, Colours, Fruits, or Vegetables.
 
At SSW we have adopted the animal kingdom.

![We name the PCs and label them - this one is "Great Pyrenees"](SSW-computer-Great-Pyrenees.jpeg)

While you are attaching the label, it is also a good idea to affix a business card to the underside of the computer. This way if you lose your machine, anyone who finds it can easily contact you.
