 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 
- If the Upsizing Wizard fails to map a function in a field's ValidationRule property, only the validation rule is skipped, and the rest of the table is upsized.
- If the Upsizing Wizard fails to map a function in a field's DefaultValue property, the entire table is skipped.
- Access 2000: Validation rules are not upsized





| [Upsizing PRO](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/UpsizingPRO) will check this rule  |
