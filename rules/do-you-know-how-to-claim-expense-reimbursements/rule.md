​You should be reimbursed for all reasonable expenses incurred in carrying out your duties, which are above your normal costs, to and from the office.

A common example is bus and train fares to client sites. Amounts under $40 should be reimbursed through Petty Cash. In SSW China office, amounts under ￥200 should be reimbursed through Petty Cash.


 
Remember to treat your company's money like your own and minimize costs where possible. Try to search around for a better price before committing to a purchase.

All expense claims must:

- Be work related
- Be made within a week
- Be signed by the claimant and authorized by the relevant Manager
- Be supported by Tax Invoices
- Not include alcohol, as it incurs FBT

​​If you’re in SSW China Office, all expense claims must:

- Be work related
- Only Fapiao is available
- ​​Be made within a month
- Be authorized by the relevant Manager
