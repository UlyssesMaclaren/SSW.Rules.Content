​You should be reimbursed for all reasonable expenses incurred in carrying out your duties, which are above your normal costs, to and from the office.

A common example is bus and train fares to client sites. Amounts under $40 should be reimbursed through Petty Cash.
 
If greater than $40 then use the     [expense claim form](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/StandardsInternal/Forms/ExpensesReimbursement.xls).

Use [the KM reimbursement form](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/StandardsInternal/Forms/ExpensesReimbursementKM.xlt) if you want your reasonable km expenses reimbursed.

Remember to treat your company's money like your own and minimize costs where possible. Try to search around for a better price before committing to a purchase.

1. All expense claims must:
    1. Be work related
    2. ​​Be made within a week
    3. Be signed by the claimant and authorized by the relevant Manager
    4. Be supported by Tax Invoices
    5. Not include alcohol, as it incurs FBT
