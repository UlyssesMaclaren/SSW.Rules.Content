The company will reimburse all reasonable expenses incurred in the carrying out of your duties, which are above your normal costs or kms to and from work. Common examples that you are likely to apply for include bus and train fares to client sites. Amounts under $40 can be reimbursed through Petty Cash.
 
Use     [this document](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/StandardsInternal/Forms/ExpensesReimbursementKM.xlt) if you want your reasonable km expenses for kms incurred.

If greater than $40 then use the expense claim forms at     [this document](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/StandardsInternal/Forms/ExpensesReimbursement.xls).

Please treat your company's money like your own and minimize company costs where possible. Try to search around for a better price before committing to a purchase.

1. All expense claims must:
    1. Be work related
    2. Be made as soon as possible following incurrence and in any event no later than the last day of the week in which the expense occurred. They are not to be older than a week (unless you are on-site)
    3. Be signed by the claimant and authorized by the relevant Manager
    4. Be supported by Tax Invoices
    5. Not include alcohol, as it incurs FBT
2. A director may request or present a list of expenses for reimbursements. By requesting approval from another director or manager, it may prevent some non-work related expenses from being claimed. This will also place responsibility on all directors/managers to act appropriately on claiming work related expenses.
