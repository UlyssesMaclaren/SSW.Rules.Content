The company will reimburse all reasonable expenses incurred in carrying out your duties, which are above your normal costs or kms to and from the office.

A common example is bus and train fares to client sites. Amounts under $40 can be reimbursed through Petty Cash.
 
Use     [this document](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/StandardsInternal/Forms/ExpensesReimbursementKM.xlt) if you want your reasonable km expenses reimbursed.

If greater than $40 then use the [expense claim form](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/StandardsInternal/Forms/ExpensesReimbursement.xls).

Please treat your company's money like your own and minimize company costs where possible. Try to search around for a better price before committing to a purchase.

1. All expense claims must:
    1. Be work related
    2. Be made as soon as possible and no later than the last day of the week in which the expense occurred. They are not to be older than a week (unless you are on-site)
    3. Be signed by the claimant and authorized by the relevant Manager
    4. Be supported by Tax Invoices
    5. Not include alcohol, as it incurs FBT
