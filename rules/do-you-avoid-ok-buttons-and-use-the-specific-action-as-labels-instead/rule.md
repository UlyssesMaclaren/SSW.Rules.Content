While "OK" buttons were the standard convention with operating systems of the past, web applications should use a more user-friendly approach to dialog boxes.<br>Instead of "OK" buttons to confirm an action the users want, it’s more efficient and effective to give them button that is labeled with that specific action.<br> [[badExample]]
