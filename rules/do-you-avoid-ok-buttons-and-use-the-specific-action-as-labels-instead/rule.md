 While "OK" buttons were the standard convention with operating systems of the past, web applications should use a more user-friendly approach to dialog boxes.<br>Instead of "OK" buttons to confirm an action the users want, it’s more efficient and effective to give them button that is labeled with that specific action.<br> <dl class="badImage"><dt>​<img src="/DesignandPresentation/RulestoBetterInterfacesGeneral/PublishingImages/OKBadExample.png" alt="Ok"></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad example - web application&#160;button labeled as&#160;&quot;OK&quot;</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt>​<img src="/DesignandPresentation/RulestoBetterInterfacesGeneral/PublishingImages/OKGoodExample.png" alt="OK"></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good example -&#160;button is labeled with the specific action​</dd></dl>​​​​​
