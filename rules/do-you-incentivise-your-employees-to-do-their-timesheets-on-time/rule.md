Having a reward system in place can be a great way to make sure all employees get their timesheets in on time.

Get your employees to enter [their timesheets daily](/Pages/when-to-enter-your-timesheets.aspx) and have a system that entails:

- A daily email sent to remind everyone to finalize their timesheets
- A Friday email to update their [service calendar](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=f33028a9-bf89-4237-87b4-3ef61eba65bf) and clean up any papers on their desks (before the cleaners come on the weekend)
- A deadline for submitting timesheets (**Friday 5pm)**. If all timesheets are received on time, everyone is rewarded with a free lunch. However, if someone fails to enter their timesheets, they will be put on the "SHAME LIST" and all team members will miss out on the free lunch.    **Hi All,**
 
No free lunch this week because of: 
 
• Person 1’s name
• Person 2’s name
• etc
 
Can you please complete your timesheets ASAP and little ‘r’ me when you are done
 
I get my information from: [https://reports.ssw.com.au/Reports/Pages/Report.aspx?ItemPath=%2fSSWTimePRO%2fSSWTimePRONETReports%2f11\_ValidateMissingTimesheets​](https&#58;//reports.ssw.com.au/Reports/Pages/Report.aspx?ItemPath=/SSWTimePRO/SSWTimePRONETReports/11_ValidateMissingTimesheets) 
 
&lt;This email was sent as per the rule: [https://rules.ssw.com.au/Management/Rules-to-Better-Timesheets/Pages/reward-your-employees-for-doing-their-timesheets.aspx​](/Management/Rules-to-Better-Timesheets/Pages/reward-your-employees-for-doing-their-timesheets.aspx) &gt;


**Note: **The Free Lunch should not accumulate. It's an 'on the day' reward, so take it or leave it... If they're not in the office, give them 30 days to get the $10.00 Tax Invoice back to Accounts for reimbursement.
