Improper spelling, grammar, and punctuation gives a bad impression of your company and can result in your message not being conveyed correctly. Emails with no full stops or commas are difficult to read and can sometimes even change the meaning of the text. And, if your program has a spelling checking option, why not use it?
 
### Web Content


Go to [Grammarly](https&#58;//app.grammarly.com/), create a New Document and Paste your content to check your text.

It's also a good idea to [install Grammarly Addon for Chrome](https&#58;//chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen) so you can automatically check web content while editing in a CMS for example.

### Documents
