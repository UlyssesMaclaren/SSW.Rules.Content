Once you create an opportunity, you should click the "Follow Up" button to           create an activity to call up the client after approximately 1 week. Each time you           make this call, you should complete the activity and create a new one, with a time           interval based on the specific circumstances of the opportunity.

You can see your outstanding activities in your CRM workspace homepage, and this           should keep you on top of all of your current opportunities.

Make sure you never have an opportunity in CRM without a follow up activity against           it; otherwise you're just hoping that they will remember to call you, which is never a good           sales strategy.         

The alternative to CRM activities is to use [FollowUpThen](/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/FollowUpEmailsEffectively.aspx) instead. This is more convenient but is not centralised, meaning that ​when a salesperson leaves an organisation, their opportunities will need to be handed over manually.
