<dd>Figure&#58; In the first example, although the text is technically aligned, it does not 'look' it. In the second one, the &quot;V&quot; has been moved into the margin, but the optical alignment is now correct</dd></dl>   â€‹
Not only relevant in typography, optical alignment can also be used in forms and web.

<dd>Figure&#58; Bad example - The fields are aligned to the radio buttons, but it doesn't &quot;look&quot; good enough</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/good_opticalalignment.png" alt="Good alignment"></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; Good example - It seems neater, even though it is no longer technically aligned</dd></dl>
