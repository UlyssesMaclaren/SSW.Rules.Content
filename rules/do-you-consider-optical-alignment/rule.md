<dd>Figure: Bad example - The fields are aligned to the radio buttons, but it doesn't "look" good enough</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="../../assets/good_opticalalignment.png" alt="Good alignment"></dt>
<dd>Figure: Good example - It seems neater, even though it is no longer technically aligned</dd></dl>
