As an Account Manager you'll frequently be required to find a free resource to put          onto a project. Instead of going around and asking everyone “Who’s free          next week?”, you should use the CRM Service Calendar.

The calendar provides          a one page view of everyone’s availability for a given time period. Here’s          what you need to do to access it:


1. Go to [<font color="#3a66cc">http&#58;//crm.ssw.com.au</font>](http&#58;//crm.ssw.com.au/)
2. Click Service | Service Calendar
3. Choose Month, Week, or Day view to suit yoru needs




All of the Appointments in the Service Calendar will also sync to the developers' outlook calendars, keeping them up to date with where they need to be, when.

You have multiple options of ways to fill this data, which you can see in [Scheduling - Do you know how to book developers for a project?](/Communication/RulesToBetterCRMForUsers/Pages/How-to-book-developers-for-a-project.aspx)

 <dl class="image">            <dt>
              <img alt="Toolbar CRM section in Inbox" src="/Communication/RulesToBetterCRMForUsers/PublishingImages/CRMServiceCalendar.jpg"></dt>
            <dd>
              Figure&#58; Service Calendar in CRM </dd>
          </dl>
However, the out of the box CRM service calendar has some limitations:

1. "Service Calendar" link on left navigation does not appear when outlook is opened.<br>              You can solve this problem by modifying CRM's default sitemap. See [Microsoft KB Article](http&#58;//support.microsoft.com/kb/916921) for more details.
2. CRM Service Scheduler creates an appointment in outlook for the scheduler and<br>the resources when scheduling an appointment. This causes a problem for the sales<br>              person because he has to schedule a lot of service activities for different resources as<br>              CRM will create all the appointments in his outlook calendar and makes it impossible<br>              for him to track his own appointments.



> > To work around this issue, you can:


    1. Create a user account for your sales team to schedule all the bookings in CRM or
    2. Set the Owner of the appointments to be the person being booked
