 If you are working remotely you should be sharing your screen with your programming partner for the majority of the day. This allows you and your programming partner to see changes that are happening on screen, making the remote collaboration experience much nicer. 
For a list of our recommended screen sharing tools, please check the     [SSW rules for remote support](/do-you-know-the-best-way-to-give-the-best-customer-support).​

​Another good practice that follows on from this, is to leave a S​kype session open. This eliminates to need to call your programming partner every time you have a query or question to ask.
