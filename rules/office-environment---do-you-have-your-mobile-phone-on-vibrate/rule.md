 If you were talking to someone, when their phone rang; would you want them to answer it? If they were using a loud ring tone, the only way to continue your conversation would be to wait until they had finished or, at least, they would have to get their phone out to hang up. Why should the person who called get preferential treatment and be able to jump the queue?Â 



Your mobile phone is a very useful tool. However, it can also be a nuisance. To make sure it doesn't interrupt your daily activities, you should always put it on vibrate. 
 
This has the following advantages:

- You get to only answer the phone when it is convenient for you
- You won't be interrupting conversations with clients, which can be seen as unprofessional
- You don't interrupt people's work with loud ring tones
