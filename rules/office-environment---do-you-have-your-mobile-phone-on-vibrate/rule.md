 If you were talking to someone, trying to come to a conclusion on a topic, when their phone rang; would you want them to answer it? If they were using a loud ring tone, the only way to continue your conversation would be to wait until they had finished or, at least, they would have to get their phone out to hang up. Why should the person who called get preferential treatment and be able to jump the queue? Your mobile phone is a very useful tool. However, it can also be a nuisance. To make sure it doesn't interrupt your daily activities, you should always put it on vibrate.  
This has the following advantages and disadvantages:

#### Advantages:

- You get to only answer the phone when it is convenient for you
- You won't be interrupting conversations with clients, which can be seen as unprofessional
- You don't interrupt people's work with loud ring tones


#### Disadvantages:

- If your phone (PDA) is connected to your laptop, you might not notice it ringing
- As above, but if you're away from your computer, you won't hear it from across the office
- Women generally keep their phones in their bags and so won't hear it unless it rings loudly


#### The following solution should satisfy everyone:

- Anyone who keeps their phone in their pocket should have it on vibrate
- Anyone who keeps their phone plugged into their laptop should have it on low volume settings
- All phones should be on vibrate or off while in meetings
- This is a standard (i.e. best practices) and not a rule to be enforced. This leaves room for exceptions such as slightly deaf people or women
