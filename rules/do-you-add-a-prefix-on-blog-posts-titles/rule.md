The prefix is used to give context to your blog posts (or other type of content), so users know what to expect.
 
Example 1: Use " **CODE:"** when your blog post is about coding   or " **VIDEO:"** when it has a video.

[[badExample | Post title with no prefix]]

Example 2: Use prefixes (based on the content) for grouping and a better scanning:
