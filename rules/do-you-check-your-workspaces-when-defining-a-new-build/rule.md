When defining a build, you should always check the Workspace tab. Only the workspace relevant to your build should be included.
 
If you have a number of Team Projects open from the same TFS Project Collection, all of their workspaces will be included by default.  You should remove those workspaces that arenâ€™t being used otherwise the build server will get the source for every workspace in this list before starting a build.
