<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​While working on a task or PBI, it is very important that&#160;you save any discussions or contextual information related to the work completed. This helps for future understanding of​&#160;what happened as well as providing relevant documents that support your research claims.<br></p> </span>

The sender will usually expect a response when the issue is resolved.
If a response is required, update the Acceptance Criteria with a&#160;note. E.g.​&#160;<br>Send a done email in reply to the original email (attached).​<br></p>
