When configuring your email settings for Dynamics CRM, make sure you configure Serverside Sync.

<!--endintro-->

As per CRM Tip of the Day https://crmtipoftheday.com/979/start-planning-farewell-party-for-email-router/, the CRM Email router is to be deprecated. You should use the Serverside Sync now instead.
