  <p>The first step is to use HTML rather than MS Word documents. </p>
<p>The second step is to think about location. Should it go on a Web site or Intranet? We believe in dividing it up into 2 groups&#58; </p>
<ul>
    <li>Public - e.g. /Standards</li>
    <li>Private - e.g. /Standardsinternal</li>
</ul>
The benefit with standards on the Web is to get feedback from other developers. See our <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/DeveloperSQLServer/SQLServerStandard_1_ObjectNaming.aspx">SQL Server Naming Standards</a> for an example.
<p>The third step is to decide on a web page theme so every page is consistent. I am continually surprised at how much time is wasted by managers explaining to web designers the <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Templates/SSWWebTemplate.aspx">corporate template</a> - so get smart and do one up that they can follow.</p>
