 ​​People may not pay attention on some important words in your pages. While adding<br>                    a simple and clear icon beside the words will make difference. Here are some examples:
​ ![](/PublishingImages/icon-1.jpg)                        Figure: Icon to indicate an empty shopping cart![](/PublishingImages/icon-2.jpg)                        Figure: Icon to warn some functionality may not work![](/PublishingImages/icon-3.jpg)                        Figure: Icon of OK
