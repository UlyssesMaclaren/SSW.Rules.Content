 This is just a little one… I know I have been guilty for going on about screen shots in the past.
<br>Another thing that helps readability in emails is **indentation**. <br> I’m on site with a client setting up their TFS Server. We have the TFS 2010 and WSS on the app tier and SQL 2008 Standard on a separate box. We can see Analysis Services running in Services but the configuration manager returns Error “TF 255040: You must exit Team Foundation Admin console and install SQL Server Reporting Services or at a minimum SQL Client Connectivity Tools…” SQL Reporting Services appears happy in the Advanced Configuration Wizard. Anyone have suggestions? 

<br>Mike Figure: Bad Example
