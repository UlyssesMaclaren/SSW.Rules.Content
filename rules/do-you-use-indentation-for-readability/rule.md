​Another thing that helps readability in emails is **indentation**. <br> I’m on site with a client setting up their TFS Server. We have the TFS 2010 and WSS on the app tier and SQL 2008 Standard on a separate box. We can see Analysis Services running in Services but the configuration manager returns Error “TF 255040: You must exit Team Foundation Admin console and install SQL Server Reporting Services or at a minimum SQL Client Connectivity Tools…” SQL Reporting Services appears happy in the Advanced Configuration Wizard. Anyone have suggestions? <br>

MikeFigure: Good example – this reads better
Your new text should be kept to the left. When quoting text on web pages, other people or quoting past email history, indent it.

**Note:** This is almost as important as the     [Do you use balloons instead of a 'Wall of Text'?](/Pages/HowToUseBalloons.aspx) rule.
