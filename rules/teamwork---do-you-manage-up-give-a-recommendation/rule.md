​​​​Managing up is providing your manager with an option to approve, rather than asking a general question.

What do you want to charge for Cameron's rate?

I would advise the standard $165 + GST until he has more experience.
Please approve.

Figure: Good Example – Option to approve 

When you are giving someone multiple options, you should recommend one and state why. For example:

We want to integrate our database with our website so that customers can purchase online.

The choices:

**Option A** - Buy a ready-made solution - The ready-made solution is cheap but it does not have everything that we need and has unnecessary features.        
**Option B** - Build a new solution using a third party company - It will be expensive and it will take a long time.
**Option C** - Customize a ready-made solution (Recommended) - We are able to get rid of redundant features and change it to meet our requirements. It is cheaper than building a new solution from scratch.

Please decide so I can move forward
