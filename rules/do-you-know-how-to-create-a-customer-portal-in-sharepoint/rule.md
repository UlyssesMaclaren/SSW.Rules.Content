You always need to collaborate with your customer.  They want to see new mockups, comment on features, get new releases and participate in team discussions on their particular project.

So the first thing you should do is to create a customer portal in your SharePoint extranet, and give your customer a login so they can jump in and get involved!

We use a customized SharePoint Team Collaboration site template to quickly initialize a new site for our customers.

Do you know how to create a customer portal?
 
Follow the following steps to create a Client Site.

- New window will open, on the left hand side, click on the dropdown of the clients and select New-&gt;Site. NOTE: If you don’t see this option, that means you don’t have permission to create site, talk to John or Joe to grant you appropriate permission.
