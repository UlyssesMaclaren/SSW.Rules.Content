For an appointment of one day or less, use the start and end times so that it is           easily viewed on people's calendars as 1 day appointments are easy to miss. However,           if the appointment spans more than one day (e.g. 2 weeks) it's ok to use 1 appointment           to span the whole time period, as it drastically reduces the complexity of keeping           it accurate, up to date, and showing easily on the Service Calendar.
