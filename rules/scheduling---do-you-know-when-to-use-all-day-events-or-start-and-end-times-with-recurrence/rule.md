For a 1 day appointment:

- Bad Example - An all day appointment is not as visible​ and doesn't tell the client when the developer will arrive and leave.
- Good Example - a start and end time will visibly fill his calendar and also give everyone a shared understanding of when the developer is working.


For more than 1 day, ​CRM supports recurring appointments, and this allows for more flexibility in bookings, so you should always use these over using one long appointment for a booking.
 
This also works better for Service Calendar syncing, as you can see what each person is working on each day.
