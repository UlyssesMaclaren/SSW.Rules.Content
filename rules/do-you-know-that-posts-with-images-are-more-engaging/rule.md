<span class='intro'> Posting regularly on social media is important to continue to build your brand and engage with your customer base.​<br> </span>

<p>​The best social media posts always include an image, as this is more engaging for your users and helps your followers to associate with your brand more easily.&#160;​You should try and vary these images depending on the text of the post, for example, a post about an event would be complimented by a promotional image for the event or shots from previously held events.</p><p><img src="/SiteAssets/do-you-know-to-add-images-to-your-social-media-posts/Facebook%20post%20without%20pic.jpg" alt="Facebook post without pic.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;" />&#160;</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">​​Bad Example&#58; Social media post without an image​​​​<br></dd><p><br></p><p><img src="/SiteAssets/do-you-know-to-add-images-to-your-social-media-posts/Facebook%20post%20with%20picture.jpg" alt="Facebook post with picture.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;" /><br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">​​Good Example&#58; Social&#160;​media post with an image<br></dd><p><br></p>
