<span class='intro'> This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). </span>


  <p>Data Connection Library provides a central location for defining all the connections to various data sources within your company.</p>
<ul>
    <li>It allows you to change the data source definition in one place, without having to worry about changing the same definition in 50 forms and excel spreadsheets. </li>
    <li>A centralized data connection library also helps your users to locate data easily. </li>
    <li>Your users don't want to know the intrincate details on how to get a particular data - they just want the data and have the form working!&#160; So if you as the administrator provides it for them, they will love you, they will use it, and you will have a easier time managing your SharePoint site!</li>
</ul>
Everyone wins!
