 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). ![](/TFS/RulesToBetterVersionControlwithTFS(AKASourceControl)/PublishingImages/LeaveAMessToOthers.jpg)Â Figure: Put your dishes straight in the dishwasher otherwise you leave a mess for others (aka "Check in" the right way otherwise you give other developers problems) Other recommendations have included using //TODO or commenting the code out. However we recommend avoiding this practice as it increases the risk that the code is forgotten about. 
 Note: Having [gated check-ins](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterVersionControlwithTFS%28AKASourceControl%29.aspx#MinimumBuilds)will help prevent this from happening. 
 Note: A useful tool is [TFS Auto Shelve](http&#58;//visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/080540cb-e35f-4651-b71c-86c73e4a633d)- Protect your code by guaranteeing your pending changes are always backed up to the TFS server.
