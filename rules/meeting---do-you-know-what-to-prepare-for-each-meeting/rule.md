 In Scrum, meetings are time boxed. Team members must be well prepared in order to accomplish the meeting goals in time. <br> 
**Daily Scrum Meetings** - all members of the team must be well prepared by:

- Being available in time
- Having their hours up-to-date – read [Do you update your tasks before the daily Scrum meeting?](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/UpdateTasks.aspx)
- Knowing what was done since the last meeting
- Knowing what is planned to be done until next meeting
- Explain roadblocks and impediments that might exist
- Not bringing major discussions during the time boxed meeting. Leave it for after scrum meeting
- Being online on Skype in case any of the members is on different location –
    - checking microphone and speakers in advance


**Review Meetings** - all members of the team must be well prepared by:

- Being available **30 minutes** before the meeting
- Setting up and testing the projector in a computer before the meeting starts
- Making sure remote members are connected via Skype and TeamViewer before the meeting starts
- Nominating in advance another member of the team to take notes from the presentation
- Deciding, in advance, the order in which stories should be presented; priority, sprint backlog order, logical order and minimizing presenter and presentation medium switching should be taken into account.
- Controlling the time spent on the story presentation
    - Inform the product owner what the main goal of the story
    - Tell if the team believe it was done or not
    - If the Product Owner previously saw what was done, ideally the member should just mention that and ask if the story is accepted
    - If the member needs to show something, show a couple of examples and ask if the Product Owner wants to see something else


**Retrospective meetings** - all members of the team must be well prepared by:

- Having all your tasks and user stories from the last sprint closed
- Having your sprint feedback ready in advance, so members don’t need to think about it during the meeting, saving time
- Being clear and pointing issues that need further discussions


**Planning WHAT meetings** - all members of the team must be well prepared by:

- Having all bugs and User Stories up-to-date on the backlog


**Planning HOW meetings** - all members of the team must be well prepared by:

- Understanding all Stories and Product Owner’s priorities
- Being responsible on estimates
- Volunteering to be owner of stories and tasks, even if they are not related to your best skills – read [Do you encourage multi-skilled teams?](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/BeingMultiSkilled.aspx)
