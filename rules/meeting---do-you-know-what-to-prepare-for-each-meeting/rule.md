 In Scrum, meetings are time boxed. Team members should be well prepared in order to accomplish the meeting goals in time. 

 
**Daily Scrum Meetings** - This is time boxed to 15 mins. All members of the team should be well prepared by:

- Being ready on time
- Having their "Remaining hours" up-to-date – read [Do you update your tasks before the daily Scrum meeting?](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/DailyScrumUpdateTasks.aspx)
- Be ready to answer the 3 main questions:



> > > What did you do yesterday? e.g. "Yesterday I did xxx"
> > > 
> > > What are you doing today? e.g. "Today I will do yyy"
> > > 
> > > Do you foresee​ any impediments or roadblocks? e.g. "I might hit a roadblock today because of xxx"


- Remember to say "Let's Park" that conversation for after the scrum". Major discussions are not to be conducted during the time boxed scrum meeting.
- Being online on Skype (especially for team members in different locations) Lync is better

**Review Meetings** - all members of the team must be well prepared by:

- Being available **30 minutes** before the meeting
- Setting up and testing the projector in a computer before the meeting starts
- Making sure remote members are connected via Skype and TeamViewer before the meeting starts
- Nominating in advance another member of the team to take notes from the presentation
- Deciding, in advance, the order in which stories should be presented; priority, sprint backlog order, logical order and minimizing presenter and presentation medium switching should be taken into account.
- Controlling the time spent on the story presentation
    - Inform the product owner what the main goal of the story
    - Tell if the team believe it was done or not
    - If the Product Owner previously saw what was done, ideally the member should just mention that and ask if the story is accepted
    - If the member needs to show something, show a couple of examples and ask if the Product Owner wants to see something else


**Retrospective meetings** - all members of the team must be well prepared by:

- Having all your tasks and user stories from the last sprint closed
- Having your sprint feedback ready in advance, so members don’t need to think about it during the meeting, saving time
- Being clear and pointing issues that need further discussions


**Planning meetings** - all members of the team must be well prepared by:

- Having all bugs and User Stories up-to-date on the backlog
- Having all stories on the backlog “groomed” in order of priority (according to the Product Owner)​
- Understanding all Stories and Product Owner’s priorities
- Being responsible on estimates
- Volunteering to be owner of stories and tasks, even if they are not related to your best skills – read [Do you encourage multi-skilled teams?](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/BeingMultiSkilled.aspx)
