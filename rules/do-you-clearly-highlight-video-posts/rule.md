We all know the feeling after a long day... Exhausted, we wander the internet, lazily looking for content to consume easily. For many, this normally takes the form of watching videos after trailing through their Reddit, Twitter, & other social media platforms. Therefore, it is important to make sure that your blog post titles stand out to this demographic.
 
One simple way to do this is to make sure that the first word of your blog post is "**VIDEO â€“** ".
