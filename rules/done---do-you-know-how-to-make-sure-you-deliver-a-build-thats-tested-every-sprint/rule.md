What happens when you leave all the testing to the end of the sprint? You find things that are not ***done*** and you have no time before the **Sprint Review** to fix them.


[[badExample]]
| ![ if you don’t complete all the tasks the customer will not receive a build in the sprint One way to mitigate this is to aim for a “*test please*” to occur a few days before the end of the Sprint but you still run the risk of not having enough time to make sure everything is *done.* ](RuleBuildEverySprintBad.png) 



[[okExample]]
| ![ OK example – Send the “test please” before the end of the sprint so you have time to finish everything](RuleBuildEverySprintOK.png)


It is preferable to conduct a **Smoke Test** to make sure that you are comfortable demoing the unit of work you just finished to the customer. One way to do this is to create a Coded UI test for each of the Stories as part of your Definition of Done (DoD) that runs through the functionality you have built.

In this scenario the “**test please**” with the customer happens outside of the current Sprint. 


[[goodExample]]
| ![ Good example – Create a coded UI test for each story to prove that it is complete](RuleBuildEverySprintGOOD.png)


If you are doing **Scrum** then you should have a **User Story** fleshed out with a set of **Acceptance Criteria**. These **Acceptance Criteria** are agreed with the **Product Owner** before **The Team** committed to the story, and define what the **Product Owner** will accept as complete. This makes it relatively easy to create some automated tests that test for these **Acceptance Criteria** and help your **Sprint Review** go as smoothly as possible.

Any changes found during **the Sprint Review** get added to the **Product Backlog** to be prioritised by the **Product Owner**.
