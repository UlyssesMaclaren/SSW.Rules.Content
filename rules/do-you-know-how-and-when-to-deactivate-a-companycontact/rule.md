<span class='intro'> There comes a time when some contacts in your CRM database might just be taking up space and not giving any value. At this point it is best to deactivate them. </span>

<ul>
          <li>CRM still knows about it so it will still come up for duplicate detection.</li>
          <li>You can still view them if you need to by viewing Inactive companies/contacts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Hint&#58;</b> When you deactivate a client - put a note in the notes field to say
          why first.</p>
