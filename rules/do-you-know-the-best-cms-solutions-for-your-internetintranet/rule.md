You don’t want to building solutions from scratch, take the business value you can, from a CMS and a CRM. Don't reinvent the wheel.

 The main choices are:

- [www.orchardproject.net/](http&#58;//www.orchardproject.net/)
- [www.DotNetNuke.com](http&#58;//www.dotnetnuke.com/)
- [Microsoft Sharepoint 2007](http&#58;//www.microsoft.com/office/preview/servers/sharepointserver/highlights.mspx)
- [www.CommunityServer.org](http&#58;//www.communityserver.org/)
- Microsoft ASP.NET 2.0 hand coded pages


There are pros and cons to all and it depends on what functionality/customization you need but we lean towards Orchard and Sharepoint for most solutions.
