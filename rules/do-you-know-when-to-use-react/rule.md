<span class='intro'> <p><a href="https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Angular.aspx">Angular</a> is great  for building large enterprise applications but it is a full framework that works best as a full application.</p><p>
   <b>React</b>,&#160;however, is easier to embed on another framework or application such as Office 365 or Sharepoint.</p> </span>
