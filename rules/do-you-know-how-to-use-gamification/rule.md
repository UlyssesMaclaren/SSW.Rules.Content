"Gamification" is a method of encouraging user participation. Usually these are a set of fictional incentives such as points or achievement badges.
   ​
It originated with Frequent Flyer programs and has crossed over into the software world with the success of FourSquare.

This concept is being utilized even in [Visual Studio](http&#58;//channel9.msdn.com/achievements/visualstudio) ![](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/images/external.gif "You are now leaving SSW").
