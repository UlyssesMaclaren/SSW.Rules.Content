​​​​Scrum is easier than it seems, we'll explain how in these 8 simple steps.
 ![](/PublishingImages/8Steps_preview.jpg)​Fi​gure: This Scrum image includes all the important steps from the initial meeting to the Review and Retro. Print this <br>      [SSW 8 Steps to Scrum PDF](/Documents/8StepstoScrum.pdf) and put it on your " <br>      [War Room](/Pages/ScrumVisualImage.aspx)" wall​
1. ### ​[Initial Meeting](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=459927ab-429c-4882-8822-ccfda6be4be6)
    The Product Owner explains the product vision, scope is agreed, and the number of days needed for the 'Backlog Construction' is proposed.
2. ### ​[Backlog Construction](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=e8fba769-b2de-42f5-b5a1-e6b520dab76d)
    A 'Backlog Construction' is performed, listing the features, technologies and a ball park of the number of sprints. Together with a rate, this becomes the estimate.
3. ### [Sprint Pl​anning](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=ba8d0048-f440-42a6-90c0-8f79f0973d10)
    Features are ordered by the Product Owner. The Development Team estimates and forecasts which features will be delivered in the Sprint.
4. ###          ​[Sprint](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=731a3f5d-a266-4944-876c-a45afa82832f)
    The Development Team works on features in priority order, having done a Daily Scrum and sending 'Done' emails once the           ['Definition of Done'](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=6449ae79-ba88-447e-aa48-36173029a2af)is met. A task board is often used. During this process, the team also refines items in the Product Backlog to ensure they conform to the           ['Definition of Ready'.](/Pages/Definition-of-Ready.aspx)
5. ### [Sprint Review](/Pages/SprintReviewMeeting.aspx)
    The Development Team demos all the features they've completed. Feedback is gathered. This is the real measure of the success of the Sprint.
6. ### Product Increment
    Work accepted by the Product Owner can be deployed to production. Each Sprint is a potentially shippable increment of software.
7. ​<br>      
### [Product Feedback](/Pages/CreateBugs.aspx)
    Bugs and small changes are added to the current Sprint. Other requests are added to the Product Backlog if approved by the Product Owner.
8. ### [Sprint Retrospective](/Pages/RetrospectiveMeeting.aspx)
    This is the best part: Inspecting and adapting. Upon finishing the Sprint, the Scrum Team discusses what went well, what didn't and what to improve.
