​Scrum is easier than it seems, we'll explain how in these 8 simple steps.
 
1. ### [Initial Meeting](/Management/RulesToSuccessfulSalesAndAccountManagement/Pages/Meetings-Prepare-for-the-Initial-Meeting-.aspx)
    The Product Owner explains the product vision, scope is agreed, and the number of days needed for the 'Backlog Construction' is proposed.
2. ### [Backlog Construction](/Management/RulestoBetterSpecificationReviews/Pages/Default.aspx)
    A 'Backlog Construction' is performed, listing the features, technologies and a ball park of the number of sprints. Together with a rate, this becomes the estimate.
3. ### [Sprint Planning](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/SprintPlanning%28WHAT%29Meeting.aspx)
    Features are ordered by the Product Owner. The Development Team estimates and forecasts which features will be delivered in the Sprint.
4. ### [Sprint](/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/DailyStandUpScrum.aspx)
    The Development Team works on features in priority order, having done a Daily Scrum and sending 'Done' emails once the        ['Definition of Done'](/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/DoYouGoBeyondDoneAndFollowADoneCriteria.aspx)is met. A task board is often used. During this process, the team also refines items in the Product Backlog to ensure they conform to the        ['Definition of Ready'.](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/Definition-of-Ready.aspx)
5. ### [Sprint Review](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/SprintReviewMeeting.aspx)
    The Development Team demos all the features they've completed. Feedback is gathered. This is the real measure of the success of the Sprint.
6. ### Product Increment
    Work accepted by the Product Owner can be deployed to production. Each Sprint is a potentially shippable increment of software.
7. ### [Product Feedback](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/CreateBugs.aspx)
    Bugs and small changes are added to the current Sprint. Other requests are added to the Product Backlog if approved by the Product Owner.
8. ### [Sprint Retrospective](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/RetrospectiveMeeting.aspx)
    This is the best part: Inspecting and adapting. Upon finishing the Sprint, the Scrum Team discusses what went well, what didn't and what to improve.
