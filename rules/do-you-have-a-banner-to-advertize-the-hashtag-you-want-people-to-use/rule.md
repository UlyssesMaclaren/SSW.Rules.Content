 Twitter hashtags aggregate similar subjects on one page, so users can search for a particular trend, news, event, etc. 

It is a free tool that can be used in combination with other forms of promoting services, products and events. Create a short, consistent and easy to remember hashtag so people can find and talk about your business.​
 
​You should have a banner that clearly show the hashtag people should use to refer to that specific subject.

See examples of pages that advertise their hashtags:

- [SSW TV](http&#58;//tv.ssw.com/) #SSWTV
- [Sydney .NET User Group](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/NETUG/Sydney.aspx) #NETUG
- [SSW Rules](/) #SSWRules
