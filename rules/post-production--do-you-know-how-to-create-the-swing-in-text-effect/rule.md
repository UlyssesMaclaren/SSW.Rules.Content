The text swing in can be a great way to make a title gain attention, but if the angles are wrong, the unnatural nature of it will be jarring. The best tool to create this type of effect is Adobe After Effects.

- Each keyframe should be half the angle of the previous keyframe from 90 degrees
- Each keyframe should be half the distance on the timeline from the previous keyframe
