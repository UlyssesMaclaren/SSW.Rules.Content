 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 
If you're outside the network you will need the VPN at the moment. We have a task to make it visible externally but we need more external IP addresses first.

You can track progress on this at: [NET-48](http&#58;//jira.ssw.com.au/browse/NET-48)

See screen below for sign in details
