 Having a documented process for managing engagements provides clients with a consistent experience. It also helps to get new employees up to speed quickly, and provides a reference to existing employees to ensure no steps are accidentally missed. 
​

Our engagement lifecycle overlaps with our     [sales pipeline](/Management/RulesToSuccessfulSalesAndAccountManagement/Pages/The-6-stages-in-the-Sales-Pipeline.aspx), and maps to the     [8 Steps to Scrum](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/8Steps.aspx).

Figure: Good Example - Engagement Lifecycle


1. Initial Phone Call
    - The client has made contact but no initial meeting has yet been made
2. [Initial Meeting](/Management/RulesToSuccessfulSalesAndAccountManagement/Pages/Meetings-Prepare-for-the-Initial-Meeting-.aspx) - Booked
    - Sales team has arranged an initial meeting and it's booked in.
    - The Initial Meeting is a non-billed meeting that maps to the Initial Meeting described in the <br>         [8 Steps to Scrum](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/8Steps.aspx). It is attended by a Sales person and ideally a Solution Architect.
3. Follow Up Meeting - Booked
    - In some cases, more than one initial meeting may be required before work or speccing commences.
4. [Specification Review](/Management/RulestoBetterSpecificationReviews/Pages/Default.aspx) Proposal - Waiting for Approval
    - After the Initial Meeting, if the work requires it, a specification review is proposed.
5. Specification Review - Booked
    - The Specification Review meeting has been approved and booked in.
    - The Specification Review is a billed meeting with the customer to review existing specifications, understand specific goals, risks and relevant technologies appropriate for the solution, and create the initial backlog.
    - During the Specification Review, the Solution Architect prepares a document, presentation, or video outlining the results of the Specification Review, as per [Spec - Do you effectively present the outcomes at the "Specification Review Presentation"?](/Management/RulestoBetterSpecificationReviews/Pages/SpecificationReviewPresentation.aspx).
6. Project Proposal - Waiting for Approval
    - After the Specification Review, the client is given a proposal for a chunk of work. Once this is approved, the Sales Team closes the opportunity as 'won'.
    - Proposal is sent to the client including financials and the result of the Specification Review.
7. Project Execution
    - The <br>         [Scrum](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/8Steps.aspx) process runs, starting with the first sprint forecast email, as per <br>         [Do you create a Sprint Forecast? (aka The functionality that will be developed during the Sprint)](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/Do-you-create-a-Sprint-Forecast-email.aspx).
8. Project Closure
    - Project is completed, any handover or other transition that has been defined is completed with the client.
