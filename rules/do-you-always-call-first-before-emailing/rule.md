 ​​​To prevent downtime waiting for a response you should always call first before emailing. 
​

Calling first can save valuable time versus waitng for someone to respond to your email, making you more productive. [Do you seek clarification via the telephone first? ​](/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/SeekClarificationViaTelephoneFirst.aspx)​as calling first also saves time when discussing topics that are easier explained over the phone. ​

When you need to contact someone the steps you should take are:



1. Ping them on Skype asking "Can I talk to you"
2. Call them. If you do not get through leave a [voice message​](/Management/Rules-to-Better-Software-Consultants-Working-in-a-Team/Pages/DoYouUseVoiceMessagesWhenAppropriate.aspx).
3. After talking with the person follow up with an email that [begins with the words "As per our conversation"​](/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/DoYouAlwaysSendAnAsPerOurConversationEmail.aspx)


​
​It is very unliekly a client will complain becuase you contact them too often but it is likely they will if you only ever email, so do not be afraid of calling first before emailing.
