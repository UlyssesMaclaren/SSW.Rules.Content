Having     an electronic task board makes it easy for developers to keep track of tasks.

These are the columns (aka swim lanes) you need:

Near your task board, stick an SSW "Want to submit a User Story?"

- Where to find their project portal
- Who to contact with questions
- How to add tasks to the task board


Print out this PDF and fill in the 2 fields and stick it on own task board.
