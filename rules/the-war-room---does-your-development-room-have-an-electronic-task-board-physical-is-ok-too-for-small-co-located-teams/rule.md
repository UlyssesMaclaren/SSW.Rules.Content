 Having a physical task board makes it easy for developers to keep track of tasks. 

These are the columns (aka swim lanes) you need:  ![](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/PublishingImages/Taskboard.jpg) Figure: a physical client taskboard in operation.![TFS Preview Task Board.png](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/PublishingImages/TFS%20Preview%20Task%20Board.png)


Figure: a virtual client taskboard in action ([TFS​](http&#58;//tfspreview.com/)).


Here at SSW every taskboard is accompanied by a page that lists clearly three things that clients need to know:

- Where to find their project portal
- Who to contact with questions
- How to add tasks to the taskboard


Print out this pdf and attach it to your own taskboard.
