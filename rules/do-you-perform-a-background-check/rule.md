If you do not have a system for ranking all the potential clients who come knocking on your door, you will be open to accepting a troublesome client or two and a whole heap of headaches.                     You could ask if they have any references from other companies, but a less drastic, and less confrontational check is a quick Google search.
 
- Do they turn up in the results?
- Do they have a webpage?
- Does the webpage look legitimate (not just thrown together)?
- Is the "Contact Us" Address and/or phone number the same as the one they provided?
- Do they have any references from other companies?


With this information you can then rank them from "Not a Risk" all the way up to "Huge Risk" (the kind with neon flashing lights and all) and decide whether or not to go ahead with the business deal.
