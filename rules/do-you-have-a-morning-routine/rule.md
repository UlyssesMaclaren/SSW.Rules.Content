<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">If you are spending many days working remotely, it is vital to remain in some sort of morning routine.​<br></p> </span>

<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​This means not just rolling out of bed in your PJs and starting work​&#160;as is. This can be damaging to your mental health over time so it is vital to keep some sort of normality.&#160;​Change your clothes, eat your breakfast, get ready for work.<br></p>
