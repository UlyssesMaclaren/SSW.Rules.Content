It is important to ensure that if you have a Remote-Access VPN that the tpye of VPN you are using is secure. Previously PPTP was a popular method, but this is now a depricated service as it can be hacked very quickly using online tools.




It is recommended to go with a provider such as OpenVPN or Cisco AnyConnect.
