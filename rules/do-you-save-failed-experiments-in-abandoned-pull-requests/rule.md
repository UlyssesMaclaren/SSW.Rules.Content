<span class='intro'> If you create a branch intending to develop a cool new feature but the result is not something that will be merged into master. Make sure to create a Pull Request anyway and set the status to Abandoned. Also make sure to link this PR with the related PBI. Feel free to continue and delete your branches as normal.<br><br><img src="/SiteAssets/do-you-save-failed-experiments-in-abandoned-pull-requests/create-pr-for-failed-branch.png" alt="create-pr-for-failed-branch.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" /><div><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Good Example&#58;&#160;Setup pull request for feature branch so that we have a history of the commits<br></dd><div><br></div></div><div><img src="/SiteAssets/do-you-save-failed-experiments-in-abandoned-pull-requests/abandoned-pr-for-branch.png" alt="abandoned-pr-for-branch.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" /><br></div><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">â€‹Good Example&#58;&#160;PR is abandoned with a deleted branch<br></dd><div><br></div> </span>
