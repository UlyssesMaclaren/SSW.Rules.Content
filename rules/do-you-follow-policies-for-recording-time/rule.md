​There needs to be consistency between all of your developers' timesheets, so you should get them all to adhere to the following:

- Be accurate. Read [Do you know how to describe the work you have done?​](/Management/Rules-to-Better-Timesheets/Pages/how-to-describe-the-work.aspx)'Fixed Bug on customer form'Figure: Bad example'Investigated and improved the  validation on customer form to enable saving when Customer Name is &gt; 100 characters' Figure: Good example
- Record all the work you do for a client, even if it is to be written off
- If you are working with another employee, ensure your times are consistent, in both time and category
- If you are providing telephone support, count your time in 15 minute blocks
- If you work for a client 4 times in a day for 15 minutes each, feel free to enter one timesheet for 1 hour, listing the 4 things you did. The extra information adds no value and only serves to clutter up invoices
