<span class='intro'> <p>There should always be consistency between all of your developers' timesheets, so you should get them all to adhere to the following&#58;</p><ul><li>Be honest</li><li>Record your time whenever you are doing work for a client, even if it is to be written off.</li><li>If you are working with another employee, ensure your times are consistent, in both time and category.</li><li>If you are providing telephone support, count your time in 10 minute blocks</li><li>If you work for a client 4 times in a day for 15 minutes each, feel free to enter one timesheet for 1 hour, listing the 4 things you did. The extra information adds no value and only serves to clutter up&#160;invoices.</li></ul> </span>
