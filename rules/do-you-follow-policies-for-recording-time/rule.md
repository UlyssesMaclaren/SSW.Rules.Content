- Be honest
- Record your time whenever you are doing work for a client, even if it is to be written off.
- Round start/end/break times to the nearest 10 minutes (avoid rounding up time as this gives the impression to the client we are "penny pinching")
- If you are working with another employee, ensure your times are consistent
- If you are providing telephone support, count your time in 10 minute blocks
