 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 
Having had the conversation, reply to the email (remembering to CC all involved) with:

- Reply to the original email (Do not change the subject because it will break the threading).
- Update the email with the new details arising from the conversation along with all original content. (Remember to start with an "As per our conversation" line).
- Action the tasks from the email


Another benefit of this type of email is so that you can subtly let the person know that next time they need to provide more details.

However, sometimes you just cannot reach the task owner. In this case, you need to keep contacting this person for 24 hours. If you are still not able to contact the person or the clarification is not enough for you to action the task, you need to reply to the email and put the following in red in the first line: 
<dl class="good"><dt>
<p><b>Hi John</b></p>
<p style="color&#58;red;">(FYI&#58; Clarification was needed to complete this task - next time, please include additional information like the below so I can complete this task autonomously)</p>
<p style="color&#58;red;">This task has been put into the next release.</p>
<p><b>To Myself</b></p>
<p></p>[Fill in the information you just got from the conversation] 
<p></p>
<dd>Figure&#58; Send this email and now move on to other tasks and leave this task to next release. </dd></dl>
