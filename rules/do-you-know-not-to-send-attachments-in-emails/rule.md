It's better to use links to a portal or document store instead of having attachments in your emails.

If you're sending to a fellow employee, use a link to a document store on your intranet (e.g. intranet.northwind.com/SharedDocuments)

If you're sending to a client, it would be a link to a document store on their [project portal](/Management/RulesToHappyClients/Pages/DoYouUseAProjectPageForYourTeamAndClient.aspx). (e.g. projects.northwind.com/SharedDocuments)

Tip: If you're using SharePoint, then an even better way to do this is to use a tool like OnePlaceMail to insert a link from SharePoint
