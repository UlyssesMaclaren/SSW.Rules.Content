 ​​Keeping your mind on the job is so important if you're trying to fix a bug/issue, and finalizing a task to meet this afternoon's deadline. Here are a few practical suggestions that are used in the SSW office to help the team keep "in the zone".



 
1. Programming/working in pairs means you won't cruise the web, or play Solitaire, you'll be forced to focus.
2. Don't interrupt people unnecessarily when they're working - create comprehensive standards for people to refer to.
3. Avoid multi-tasking as much as possible. Don't open an email, respond to half the questions, and then open another. Complete the first task and then delete the email. When you multi-task, there’s a higher chance your work quality will be dropped, as well as your attention to detail.
4. Set your Browser's default to "About: Blank"  so you don't get distracted by news or social media, for example.
5. [Minimize Outlook distractions](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=7d2b06ad-cac7-4afc-b7af-0552fe30b6ac).
6. [Minimize Skype distractions](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulestoBetterInstantMessenger.aspx#MinimiseMSNMessengerDistractions).
7. [Minimize Microsoft Team distractions](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=ab17d85c-5ee1-44a9-8433-200bd5771337).
8. People should [avoid distracting you](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=3e0a3341-90ff-4b73-92d0-d14fb3e7ed13), but it’s easier when they know what you are working on. As an example, Use Teams status to let people know what you are doing without having to ask you as per [https://rules.ssw.com.au/use-the-status-message-in-teams](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=8deaea57-532b-4446-9eb2-f906830dd222).
9. Use a concentration technique, such as [Pomodoro​](https&#58;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
10. If you are in a meeting, it’s a good idea to put your cell phone in a “do not disturb” mode so you can fully concentrate.



TIP:​​ There is an extension for Google Chrome to replace your homepage called Momentum ([https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en-US](https&#58;//chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en-US)) where you will be shown a photograph as the background, time, greetings, and your own focus for the day.

**​​Fig​ure: The ​Pomodoro technique ****uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.**
