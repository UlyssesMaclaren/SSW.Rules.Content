<span class='intro'> This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). </span>


  <p>However, requesting a signature (or just an initial) on non-contractual type documents, especially screen-shots or data-schemas, is very beneficial. When you ask a client to 'review this screen mock-up' they will generally take a cursory glance, perhaps make a comment or two and then move on to something else. Asking them to then initial the print-out of the screen mock-up always makes them take a second or third look, ask someone else, or at least spend a few more minutes working out whether it's correct.</p>
<p>Training clients to continually review work carefully leads to more better quality work.</p>
