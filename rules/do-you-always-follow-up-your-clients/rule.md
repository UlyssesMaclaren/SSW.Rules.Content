If you have followed the previous rule and the ball is always in their court, you need to make sure that they keep playing.

The best way to do this is to make sure you follow up all communications that require a reply, whenever you feel that a bottleneck is forming.

The best ways to follow up a client are:

- Use email
<br>    If there is no response, find the original email and resend. See our [Rules To Better Email - Do you know how to hurry someone up?](/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/HurrySomeoneUp.aspx), [Rules to Better Email - Do you always follow up your clients?](/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/FollowUpEmailsEffectively.aspx) and [Rules to Better Email - Do you realize the importance of a good email Subject?](/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/ImportanceOfAGoodSubject.aspx)
- Use IM or Skype
<br>    See our [Rules To Better Instant Messenger - Do you communicate more efficient?](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulestoBetterInstantMessenger.aspx#ChatEfficient)
- Use the phone
<br>    Call them
