 Documenting your WebAPI is important but you don't want to spend a massive amount of time trying to keep documentation up to date. The solution ​is to use [Swagger](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md)and [Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle)​
 
​​​​​Implementing Swashbuckle with give you an automatic UI to explore and test your WebAPI methods.
