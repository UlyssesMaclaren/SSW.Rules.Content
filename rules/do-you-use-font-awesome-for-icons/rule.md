 ​​Bootstrap comes with a good font-based icon library to use in your Web Application, but there is an even better one you should use whenever you are using Bootstrap.​   ​​​






Font Awesome provides scalable vector icons which can be customized purely through css and is completely free for commercial projects.

Using it on your project is easy, just add the following stylesheet to your app:


```
<link href="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/3.2.1/css/font-awesome.css" rel="stylesheet" />​
```


​Then you have access to over 350 icons. Here are a few that I use all the time: ​

​​​​

​​​The HTML is easy, just &lt;i class='icon-edit'&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i class='icon-trash'&gt;&lt;/i&gt;



You can also download and reference Font Awesome locally.
