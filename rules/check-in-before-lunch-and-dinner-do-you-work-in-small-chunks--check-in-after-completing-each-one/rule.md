 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). ![](/TFS/RulesToBetterVersionControlwithTFS(AKASourceControl)/PublishingImages/Check-InRegularly.jpg)Â Figure: Eating one big meal every three days gives you a bellyache... (aka check in small portions regularly, one large check-in after a few days will give you a headache)
That's why source code should be checked in regularly. We recommend a check-in:

- Immediately after completing a piece of functionality, where the code compiles and passes the unit tests
- Before lunch or dinner
- Before leaving your workstation for an extended period of time

 If the changes would break the build or are in a state that cannot be put into the main trunk, then this code should be put into a [shelveset](http&#58;//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181403.aspx) (sometimes referred to as 'sandbox') in source control. 
 Another good reason to check-in regularly is that it makes it easier to merge your changes with other developers. If all developers check-in lots of changes in one go, you will spend a lot of your time resolving conflicts instead of doing work. 
 TIP: How can you enforce regular check-ins? Monitor them using a report to see who has not checked in.
