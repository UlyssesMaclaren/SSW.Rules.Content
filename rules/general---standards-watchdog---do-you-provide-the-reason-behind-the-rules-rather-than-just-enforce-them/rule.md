A long time ago BF Skinner, a psychologist, proved through experiments that an animal                     rewarded for good behavior will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns                     far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behavior (*Fundamental Techniques<br>                        in Handling People, Brian Elfstrom*).
 
If you criticize your staff:

- You don't make lasting changes
- They will resent you, resulting in lower productivity and employee morale


An example: If one of your responsibilities is to make sure all your developers                     have signed released plans you can run around with a lot of authority telling them                     they'd better comply, but at soon as you're not around, they will resent you and                     not bother about it.
                 A better approach is, when you see developers not using signed release plans:

- Ask, "Is there anything I can do to make it easier for you to complete the release<br>                        plan or make it simpler to produce?"
- Explain that release plans are there to make sure we are working on authorized work<br>
- Explain that release plans make sure we get paid for our work - without them it<br>                        is hard to track work done on a project
