 Once you have created your issue (request) and you remain the [Reporter](/Management/RulesToBetterJira/Pages/ReportesAndAssignees.aspx), there are several ways you can track them, the most important is via your [Dashboard](http&#58;//jira.ssw.com.au/secure/Dashboard.jspa) ; see how to intepret your dashboard [here](/Management/RulesToBetterJira/Pages/SystemDashboard.aspx). <br>​ 
 Other ways are:

- using the filter [My Reported Unresolved Issues](/Management/RulesToBetterJira/Pages/TrackingRequests.aspx)
- for SysAdmin using the filter [SysAdmin Unresolved](/Management/RulesToBetterJira/Pages/TrackingRequests.aspx) shows where your request is in the queue
- placing shared filters in your favouries with [Manage Filters](/Management/RulesToBetterJira/Pages/TrackingRequests.aspx)
- creating your own filters and sharing them, do this with a [Find Issues](/Management/RulesToBetterJira/Pages/TrackingRequests.aspx)and then save it as a filter and share it
- make shared dashboards your favourites and create new ones with [Manage Dashboards](/Management/RulesToBetterJira/Pages/TrackingRequests.aspx)
