 Once you have created your issue (request) and you remain the [Reporter](/Management/RulesToBetterJira/Pages/ReportesAndAssignees.aspx), there are several ways you can track them, the most important is via your [Dashboard](http&#58;//jira.ssw.com.au/secure/Dashboard.jspa) ; see how to intepret your dashboard [here](/Management/RulesToBetterJira/Pages/SystemDashboard.aspx). <br> 
 Other ways are:

- using the filter [My Reported Unresolved Issues](http&#58;//jira.ssw.com.au/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&amp;requestId=10100)
- for SysAdmin using the filter [SysAdmin Unresolved](http&#58;//jira.ssw.com.au/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&amp;requestId=10021) shows where your request is in the queue
- placing shared filters in your favouries with [Manage Filters](http&#58;//jira.ssw.com.au/secure/ManageFilters.jspa)
- creating your own filters and sharing them, do this with a [Find Issues](http&#58;//jira.ssw.com.au/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=show&amp;createNew=true)and then save it as a filter and share it
- make shared dashboards your favourites and create new ones with [Manage Dashboards](http&#58;//jira.ssw.com.au/secure/ConfigurePortalPages%21default.jspa)
