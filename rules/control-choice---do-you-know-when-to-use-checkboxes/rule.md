If the option only contains 2 choices, and the answer is a Boolean type value where the opposite value is clear (e.g. Enabled/Disabled, True/False, Yes/No, On/Off), it should always be a checkbox.
![ Bad Example - Boolean options not using CheckBox![A CheckBox is used for Boolean type value.](../assets/UsingCheckBox.gif)](../assets/NotUsingCheckBox.gif)
Only 1 CheckBox is used as the opposite value is clear, such controls are often CheckBoxes in a ListView too. E.g.:

CheckBoxes are also suitable to use for enable or disable sections and to tell the user that these sections do not need configuring for the application to run.
![ Good Example - CheckBoxes are used (although no opposite values), because they are clear when the CheckBoxes aren't ticked, the sections are disabled![Not using checkboxes](../assets/UseCheckBoxBad.gif)](../assets/CheckBoxSection.gif)
If there are only two options available on the form (usually a yes/no answer), the use of a checkbox is more intuitive than radio buttons. Only use radio buttons if there are more than two options.
![ Bad Example â€“ Radio buttons are not appropriate when there are only two options![These yes/no questions have a better representation with checkboxes](../assets/checkbox-for-two-options.jpg)](../assets/radio-for-two-options.jpg)
