For Azure DevOps Server (and old TFS servers)
Note: If using Azure DevOps (cloud) then you have no method of tracking changes to the Process Template

The customized process template is a very important asset for your team, you should use Source Control to store the work-in-progress template so you can track the changes and avoid mistakes.

You should also keep a version history log in ProcessTemplate.xml so you can track the deployed version easily.
