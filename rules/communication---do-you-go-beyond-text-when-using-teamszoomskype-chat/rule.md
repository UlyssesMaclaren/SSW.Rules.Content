Communication in English can be difficult if it is not your first language. In these cases it might be tempting to only communicate via IM, but this will not improve your skills or build a relationship as well as communicating verbally.

1. Stop: Just using IM
2. Start: Asking ‘Can I call you?’
3. Start: Using video call at least in the first 10 seconds
4. Start: Make up for weak English by typing while speaking

​​​Also, to add up to that, you should check a couple important things before making a video call, to ensure everyone is receiving the same video and message with a good quality:


1. Answer the call
2. Check the sound quality of the microphone, ensure there is no background noise interfering with your voice
3. Check the image quality of the camera. The person on the other end of the call should be able to see your face clearly
4. After all is checked, the other person should rate the call from 0 to 10 to make sure the quality was good enough.​
