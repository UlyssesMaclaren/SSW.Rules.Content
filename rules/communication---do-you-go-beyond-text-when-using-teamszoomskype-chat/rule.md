Communication can be difficult  (even if English is your first language!). It might be tempting to only communicate via IM, but this will not improve your skills or build a relationship as well as communicating verbally.​​
Stop: Just using text in IM
Start: Asking ‘Can I call you?’ (Especially for complicated conversations)

...
Start: Using a video call (if weak bandwidth just use it for the first 10 seconds and say "I'll turn off video to save bandwidth")
Start: It's always helpful to confirm things you're talking about with typed text during the call (Especially helpful for people with English as a second language)

Here are some tips to have a better call:​
       

1. Answer the call with video
2. Sound - Be ready with the headset already on (it looks disorganized plugging it in after you take the call)
3. Sound - Check the sound quality of the microphone - you need a good mic and it should be close to your mouth - if you are using the laptop mic, sit in close.
4. Video - Check the image quality of the camera. Beware of the angle of the camera - the ones with thin bezels now put the camera at the base, looking up your nose. Avoid them.
5. Consider what is in the background
6. Help the other person by taking a screenshot and giving them a mark /10 with good and bad feedback of the call quality and background.
7. ​​Get your video background right. Check  [Rules to Better Branding](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=f6b90f42-7f48-4c44-b766-295de647bb47)
