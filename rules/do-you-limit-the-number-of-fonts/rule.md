Each font or style (italics or bold) should be used consistently throughout your presentation. While a different font face or color is a simple way of highlighting certain terms you want for focus, too much of it will do exactly the opposite and distract the audience.

The rules are:

- Use one font per presentation
- Use one style (eg. bold or color) per slide if possible
- Steer clear of excessively bright colors or any flourished type face (both are hard to read)

![ Bad Example - 2 fonts are used, 2 styles are used, and flourished type face used. This all makes your slide hard to read for the audience![](GoodLimitFont.jpg) ](BadLimitFont.jpg)
