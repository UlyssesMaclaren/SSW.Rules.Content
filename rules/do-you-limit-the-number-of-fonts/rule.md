Each font or style (italics or bold) should be used consistently throughout your presentation. While a different font face or color is a simple way of highlighting certain terms you want for focus, too much of it will do exactly the opposite and distract the audience.

The rules are:

- Use one font per presentation
- Use one style (eg. bold or color) per slide if possible
- Steer clear of excessively bright colors or any flourished type face (both are hard to read)

    <dd class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Better Example - Even though there are a lot of words, the main ones are clear because there is only one font used, with color to emphasize</dd></dl>
