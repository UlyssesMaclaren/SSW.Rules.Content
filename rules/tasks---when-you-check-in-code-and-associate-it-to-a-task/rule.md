In Scrum, you work only on tasks in a sprint, and the task must belong to a committed User Story. As such, when you check in code in TFS, you should associated it with the task you are working on rather than the committed User Story.  The reason behind this is that doing so provides a better way to track change sets in a sprint and give full traceability for work done during the sprint.
