Refactoring is all about making code easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its behavior.
 
As a rule of thumb, no methods should be greater than 50 lines of code. Long-winded methods are the bane of any developer and should be avoided at all costs. Instead, a method of 50 lines or more should be broken down into smaller functions.
