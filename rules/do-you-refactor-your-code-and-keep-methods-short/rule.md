<span class='intro'> <p>Refactoring is all about making code easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its behaviorâ€‹. <br></p> </span>

<p>As a rule of thumb, no methods should be greater than&#160;50 lines&#160;of code. Long-winded methods are the bane of any developer and should be avoided at all costs. Instead, a method of 50 lines or more should be broken down into smaller functions.<br></p>
