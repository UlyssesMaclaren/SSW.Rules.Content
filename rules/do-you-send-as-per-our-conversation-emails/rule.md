​Implement a policy of following up     **important** telephone conversations with an email that begins with the words "As per our conversation". The intent is to document what was said and agreed upon.

Watch the video below and see how a single email can make your job easier.

It is not just a 'cover my ass' email. This is for several reasons:

- To make sure that you did not get the message wrong
- To keep an audit trail of agreed decisions
- To keep people, who were not a party to the conversation, informed about the progress


Use this approach internally and with clients. As a result, expect to see "as per our conversation" emails that:

- **Require a task to be completed **
- Explain the logic of the decision
- Include URLs that were referred to
- Can be referred back to in the future


**Note:** This is most likely to happen after a conversation started        **by the client**.
If        **you** are the one making the first contact, also follow:        [Do you prepare, then confirm conversations/decisions?](/Pages/PrepareAndConfirm.aspx)
