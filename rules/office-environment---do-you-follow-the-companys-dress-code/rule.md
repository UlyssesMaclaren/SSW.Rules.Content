​​The way you and all members of your team present themselves is a crucial part of                     creating a good impression for your clients, particularly in their first encounters                     with you.
 
### Dressing Up

One aspect of this is dress code. Dress code is important for two reasons:

- Looking professional and keen for business
- Reinforce the company's [branding](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterBranding.aspx#BrandingEmployees)


It is desirable to have variety, to allow the employees to dress up and dress down.

For example, our employees **"Dress Up" on Mondays and Tuesdays by wearing company colors**... with a nice shirt (business or polo), trousers, belt, nice shoes (no sneakers, joggers or thongs). So most employees wear their SSW shirts on Mondays​.​

### The Obvious​

Of course when in a public​ event such as a User Group, conference or seeing clients you should "Dress Up".​

It should go without saying, but of course things such as shaving off your weekend facial growth, using deodorant and having clean teeth and nice breath is assumed.


"There is nothing wrong with being the best dressed man in the room."



**Sean Connery**​


### Dressing Down (aka Casual Fridays)

Many companies find it a good idea to have Casual Fridays. It is free and easy to do and gives the team something to look forward to.

Eg. At SSW,     they encourage their employees to **"Dress Down" later in the week... so they have "Casual Thursday" and "Sporty Friday"**.

Thursday are casual clothes… on Fridays they encourage sport clothes, such as shorts. It allows the end of the week to be fun.
