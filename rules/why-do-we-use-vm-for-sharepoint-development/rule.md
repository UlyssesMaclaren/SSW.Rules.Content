<span class='intro'> All SharePoint customization and development must be done on a Virtual Machine. 
 </span>

<ol>
    <li>It's very important to correctly setup a SharePoint environment for development. Correctly configured, this will save you a lot of trouble later on. </li>
    <li>From time to time, you can seriously damage a SharePoint installation during development and it is best not to install SharePoint on your everyday working machine. Additionally, when you start a new SharePoint project you don't want to carry all the luggage from a previous customization that could potentially affect your new project. </li>
    <li>Virtual machines can be fired up and shut down easily </li>
    <li>Virtual machines can be relocated on a different server and thus it doesn't waste developers' own computer resources </li>
    <li>Virtual machines can be copied and brought to a client for demostration. </li>
    <li>Very easy for someone to quickly create a new SharePoint server to quickly test or experiment with SharePoint. </li>
    <li>Bad&#58; There might be more work required to activate additional servers. </li>
</ol>
