When a user clicks on a hyperlink they expect to open an HTML file. If you click on a hyperlink (but it is actually a .doc file) you wait and wait while it takes forever to instantiate an instance of Microsoft Word in the background.
 
Don't surprise users! Use the following icons:


| File Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| PDF | ![Icon PDF](../../assets/IconPdf.png) This is a PDF file<br> |
| JPG | ![Icon JPG](../../assets/IconJpg.gif) This is an Image file |

  ![ Bad Example - The user would expect all these hyperlinks to work the same way](../../assets/IconImageBad.gif)

### How to add an icon before a link with CSS

Add the icon image to your server. Then use $= to make the match the extension of the >a< tag on your CSS. The padding is to give it some space before the text (where the icon will be).

a[href$='.pdf'] 
{ 
background: transparent url(/images/icon\_pdf.gif) center left no-repeat; 
padding-left: 20 px; 
}
