​​You should use OneNote instead of the default Wiki. This way you can use it offline on your mobile apps.

 ​​
![](teams-best-wiki-1.jpg)Bad Example: Default tab – Wiki. There is no offline mobile application
![](teams-best-wiki-2.jpg)Good Example: Use OneNote. Now you can use the normal OneNote Desktop and Mobile app for iOS and Android (including offline support)
​

**​Note:** Rename the tab to show that it is a OneNote Tab. E.g.:​ "**OneNote - SSW Reno Sydney**"​​
