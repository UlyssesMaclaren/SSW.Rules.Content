You should use OneNote instead of the default Wiki. This way you can use it offline on your mobile apps.

 
![Default tab â€“ Wiki. There is no offline mobile application](teams-best-wiki-1.jpg)
![Use OneNote. Now you can use the normal OneNote Desktop and Mobile app for iOS and Android](teams-best-wiki-2.jpg)(including offline support)


**Note:** Rename the tab to show that it is a OneNote Tab. E.g.: "**OneNote - SSW Reno Sydney**"
