Nowadays there are a variety of online video hosting solutions to choose from and it's important you pick the right service for the right purpose.
 
YouTube is great for exposure, social media sharing and channel creation/maintenance, however sites like Wistia and Vimeo are better for professional purposes because they can offer things like higher video quality, player customization, improved analytics and external links - great for selling a product or service.

*SharePoint 2013 - What's New?*

Figure: Good Example for YouTube - this would be a video with the goal of getting as many hits as possible.

*SSW Web & MVC Services*

Figure: Good Example for Wistia - since the main goal for this would be to embed it on your website andÂ get clients, you wouldn't be too concerned with hits. As such, Wistia would be the best choice.
