It is important when creating a new repository, to set it up correctly. Repositories without Descriptions, ReadMe files or licenses do not appear professionally built. ![ Bad Example â€“ Without the correct .gitIgnore, files that should not be included in the repository will be added. Without the correct license, your project will either be under-protected or over-protected![](create-repository-good.png)](create-repository-bad.png)
