#### Description

The description should explain *what the error was*, followed by the *why it occurred*. Information that is useful for debugging should be included with errors where possible in a "Details" section. You should also avoid making the text unnecessarily wide. e.g.
   â€‹<dl class="badImage"><dt><img alt="Centrix - Invalid Quote" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/BadMessageBox.gif"></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example - A message box that does not intuitively alert the user</dd></dl>
- This is confusing, because it uses different terminology to the title ("estimate" instead of "quote")
- There is no punctuation
- The word "Error" is meaningless
- Line breaks are not present, so the message box is too wide and the text may wrap in the wrong spot

<dl class="goodImage"><dt><img alt="Centrix - Invalid Quote Details" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/GoodMessageBox.gif"></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - A message box that is clear, consistent and intuitive</dd></dl>
- Terminology is consistent
- Punctuation is present
- "Details" indicates that this information is useful for debugging
- The text is split across three lines, and the technical information after Details is separated from the description of the error
