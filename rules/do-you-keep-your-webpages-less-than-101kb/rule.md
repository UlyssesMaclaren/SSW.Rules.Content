In the past, Google crawl was limited to 100kb page size. These days, Google will index more than 101K of a page (actually Google will index up to 2.5MB of an HTML file), but there’s still a good reason to recommend keeping to under a hundred links or so: the User Experience. It's important to keep in mind that the faster your loading speed, the better your mobile friendliness rate will be. Remember the more small pages you have, the more links you'll get.
 
We have a program called [SSW Link Auditor​](https&#58;//sswlinkauditor.com/) to check for this rule.​
