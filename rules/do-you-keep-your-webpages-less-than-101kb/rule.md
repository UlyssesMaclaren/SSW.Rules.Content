<span class='intro'> <p>In the past, Google crawl was limited to 100kb page size. These days, Google will index more than 101K of a page (actually Google will index up to 2.5MB of an HTML file), but there’s still a good reason to recommend keeping to under a hundred links or so&#58; the User Experience. Remember the more small pages you have, more links you'll get.​​</p> </span>
