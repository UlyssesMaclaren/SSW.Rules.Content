1. Business cards
2. A network cable (optional)
3. An extension cord (optional)
4. A thumb drive on your key ring (a personal choice, but 16 GB is a good choice)
5. An external hard drive (a personal choice, but 750 GB if a good choice if you have lots of 10+ GB VMs)
6. Software DVD's (generally you can keep the .ISOs of MS Office and Visual Studio D:\DataSetup\ISOs\)
7. Current brochures - Hand them out to interested clients
8. [User story cards](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/rules/RulesToBetterProjectManagementWithTFS.aspx#PrintedStoryCard) - These help Product owners create user stories
9. [Evaluation forms](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/NETUG/UGEvaluationSurvey.aspx) - Ask for feedback if you did a presentation
10. Even a text book or two


Maybe we could combine items 4 and 5 and get a large hard disk and put the images on there.

We have one guy in our office who carries two bags, each weighing about 10 kgs. He is the SSW St. Bernard! \*

 If you need to quickly share something with your mate:

- Use a thumb drive that you carry as per [Rules to better Software Consultants - Carry a thumb drive](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBeingSoftwareConsultantsWorkingInATeam.aspx#ThumbDrive)
- Setup a wireless ad hoc network as per [http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/create-a-quick-ad-hoc-wireless-network-connection-between-two-computers-in-windows-vista/](http&#58;//www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/create-a-quick-ad-hoc-wireless-network-connection-between-two-computers-in-windows-vista/)



 \* One of our mean guys put a house brick in the bottom a bag to see if he noticed it. He carried it for 2 weeks. It was very funny.
