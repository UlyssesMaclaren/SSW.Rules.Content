  <ul>
    <li>Not having chocolate biscuits and instead keeping a bowl of fruit
    </li>
    <li>Not having coke machines and instead having a purified cold water bottle in the middle of the office
    </li>
    <li>Encouraging them to do as much exercise as possible - even doing push-ups every day.
    </li>
    <li>And instead of dinners for birthdays where you eat and drink all night, every few months we always do something fun for someone's birthday, like indoor climbing, ten-pin bowling or even a bush walk in the Blue Mountains.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also conduct a monthly weigh-in, with incentives to look after yourself. I don't encourage my developers to stay up all night investigating new stuff, and I take them away for a two weeks every year to work by the beach and get some fresh air into their system, as well some early morning swims. </p>
<p>I find that encouraging a healthy life-style really helps my team be more productive and have more fun. </p>
