 It's been called 'herding cats'. Managing the project team and keeping the client well informed during the release development phase is critical. Keeping development of the release on track involves maintaining transparency on the important variables of project management: time, scope, budget and quality. This is achieved by maintaining a strict project schedule with particular activities taking place regularly like clock-work. <br> 
Some activities are run internally; some are run with the client.
