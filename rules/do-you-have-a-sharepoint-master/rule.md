You all know about a web master, the central point of contact if the website goes down. You should know about [Schema Masters for Database Design](/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterSQLServerSchemaDeployment/Pages/DoYouHaveASchemaMaster.aspx). SharePoint should be no different.

The SharePoint master should be your companies SharePoint expert. All major changes to the SharePoint servers should be run by the SharePoint master including:

- Deploying or removing solutions and features
- Creating web applications
- Migrations
