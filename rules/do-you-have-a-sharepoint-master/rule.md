You all know about a web master, the central point of contact if the website goes down. You should know about [Schema Masters for Database Design](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=31ff17e0-672b-4918-b455-b9a2df9d5766). SharePoint should be no different.

The SharePoint master should be your companies SharePoint expert. All major changes to the SharePoint servers should be run by the SharePoint master including:

- Deploying or removing solutions and features
- Creating web applications
- Migrations
