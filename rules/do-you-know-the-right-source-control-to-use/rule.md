SSW uses and recommends Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) as a source code solution. <br> 
![Microsoft Visual Studio Team System](TFSTeam.jpg)
Here are some of the reasons why:

- Checkin policies
- Integrated Work Items and Source control
- Visual Studio IDE integration
- Code Metrics
- HTTP access via webservices
- Integrated Build Server
