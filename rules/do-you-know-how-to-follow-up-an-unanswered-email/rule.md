Sometimes the person you send your email to may not reply immediately because they're busy or just may have forgotten about it.Â  If you need an answer, use a RESEND by doing the following:
 
1. Reply to ALL
2. Put (RESEND) in 1st line of the Body
3. Plus any other instructions - such as "Hurry Up!"

This reminds the other person that you are still waiting for a response.
