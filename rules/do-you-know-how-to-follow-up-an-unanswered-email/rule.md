 Sometimes the person you send your email to may not reply immediately because they're busy or just may have forgotten about it.  If you need an answer, use a PING by doing the following:<br> 
1. Reply to ALL
2. Put (PING) in 1<sup>st</sup> line of the Body
3. Plus any other instructions - such as "Hurry Up!"

![Hurry Up](/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/ping-email.png)Figure: Good Example - (PING) written at the top of the email.
This reminds the other person that you are still waiting for a response.
