 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 
There are many other benefits of using a virtual machine for development

1. Virtual machines can be fired up and shut down easily
2. Virtual machines can run faster, via being located on a different server and thus it doesn't waste developers' own computer resources
3. Virtual machines can be copied and brought to a client for demonstration or testing
4. They are the best way to quickly test or experiment with something new
5. Bad: There might be more work required to activate additional servers
6. Bad: You need at least 2 GB of RAM


If you are after a clean, pre-configured SharePoint server image to test SharePoint, the easiest way is to [download a trial VM from Microsoft](http&#58;//www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=67f93dcb-ada8-4db5-a47b-df17e14b2c74&amp;displaylang=en)
