    <li>Virtual machines can run faster, via being located on a different server and thus it doesn't waste developers' own computer resources </li>
    <li>Virtual machines can be copied and brought to a client for demonstration or testing </li>

    <li>Bad&#58; You need at least 2 GB of RAM </li>
</ol>
