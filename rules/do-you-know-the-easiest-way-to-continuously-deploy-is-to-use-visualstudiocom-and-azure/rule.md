### TODO: AdamS â€“ Include Steps for Continuous Delivery with Azure and VisualStudio.com

If you use Azure Web Sites and VisualStudio.com you can set up continuously deployment in 5 minutes.
 
If you are using TFS 2012 on premise, or are not using Windows Azure web sites, follow the steps below to configure continuous deployment.

As you can see, there are a lot of steps and you will need at least a day to get it all right.
