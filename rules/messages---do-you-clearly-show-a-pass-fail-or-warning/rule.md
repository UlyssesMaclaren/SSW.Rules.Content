When a user looks at a test result, they want to be quickly informed. Therefore, you must make it clear weather the test has passed or failed, or is there any warning.
 
- For a pass, the message should be green in color, and a tick next to the message.

- For a fail, the message should be red in color, and a cross next to the message.

- For a warning, the message should be yellow/orange in color, and an exclamation mark next to the message.
