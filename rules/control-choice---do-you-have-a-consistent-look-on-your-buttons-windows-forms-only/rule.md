Question: What is wrong with this Picture?
<dl class="image"><dt><img alt="Inconsistent Button FlatStyles" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/InconsistentButtonStyles.jpg"></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; What is wrong?</dd></dl>   â€‹
**Answer:** There are three different types of buttons in the Application:

- *Next &gt;* - Default Window Style
- *Preview* - .NET Flat Style
- *Cancel* - Window XP Style

<dl class="image"><dt><img alt="bad divider" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/BadDivider.gif"></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; Even labels need to use FlatStyle.System. Can you spot the wrong label?</dd></dl>
See our [Rules to Better Windows Forms](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterWindowsForms.aspx#XPThemes) to implement XP Themes in .NET.


| We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Rules.aspx#ConsistentButtonStyle) to check for this rule. |
