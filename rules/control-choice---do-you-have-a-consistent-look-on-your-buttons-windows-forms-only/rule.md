Question: What is wrong with this Picture?
![Inconsistent Button FlatStyles](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/InconsistentButtonStyles.jpg)Figure: What is wrong?   â€‹
**Answer:** There are three different types of buttons in the Application:

- *Next &gt;* - Default Window Style
- *Preview* - .NET Flat Style
- *Cancel* - Window XP Style

![bad divider](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/BadDivider.gif)Figure: Even labels need to use FlatStyle.System. Can you spot the wrong label?
See our [Rules to Better Windows Forms](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterWindowsForms.aspx#XPThemes) to implement XP Themes in .NET.


| We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Rules.aspx#ConsistentButtonStyle) to check for this rule. |
