The scrum team needs a place to gather for all the scrum ceremonies. This room should have useful information on the wall to help the team work more efficiently. We recommend having the following:

- Product Roadmap
- [Definition of Done (aka Done Criteria or DOD)](/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/DoYouGoBeyondDoneAndFollowADoneCriteria.aspx)
- [Physical Task board](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/PhysicalTaskboard.aspx)
