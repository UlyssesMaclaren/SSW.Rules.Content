​​The scrum team needs a place to gather for all the scrum ceremonies. This room should have useful information on the wall to help the team work more efficiently. We recommend having the following:

- [Physical Task Board](/Pages/Taskboard.aspx) (to show to current work in progress)
- [The 8 Steps to Scrum PDF](/Documents/8StepstoScrum.pdf) (to show how we work)
- [The 3 Steps to a PBI PDF](/Documents/3StepsToAPBI.pdf) (to know the lifecycle of a PBI​)
- Product Roadmap (to let everyone know the large future priorities)
- [Definition of Done - aka Done Criteria or DoD](/done-do-you-go-beyond-done-and-follow-a-definition-of-done) (the quality that is being adheared to)

 ​ ![](/PublishingImages/war-room-bad-example.jpg) Bad Example – No Product Roadmap is on the wall, so people can be out of sync with the future plans of the Product Owner ![](/PublishingImages/war-room-good-example.jpg) Good Example – The Product Roadmap is visible at a glance
