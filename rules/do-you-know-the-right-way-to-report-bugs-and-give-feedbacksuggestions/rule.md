 ​​​​​When reporting bugs and giving product feedback, it is essential that you are as descriptive as possible, so that the developer can reproduce the error to find out what the problem is or understand what features you are requesting



Try to have one email per bu/suggestion, but if the bugs/suggestions are related or very small (e.g. they are all on the same page) then you should group them together in a single email.​

Figure: Bad Example - This email isn't going to help the developer much - it is vague and has no screen capture, and gives no alternate way for the developer to contact the user regarding the issue![do-you-know-the-right-way-to-report-bugs-good-example.png](/SiteAssets/do-you-know-the-right-way-to-report-bugs/do-you-know-the-right-way-to-report-bugs-good-example.png)
Figure: Good Example - This email includes the product name and version, the category of the issue (BUG), a screen capture and contact number, and shows that the user's system is up to date​
Also make sure your descriptions are detailed and useful as that can make finding the solution quicker and easier.


Make sure you always explain and give as much details as you can of how you got an error or a bad experience.

Where is TV.SSW on the navigation? 
Figure: Bad example - Lack of details
1. Navigated to ssw.com.au
2. Scrolling down looking for a big graphic like "CHECK OUT SSW TV! CLICK HERE!"
(Nothing)
Me, thinking… "Hmm… let's try the menu at the top..."
3. About Us? Nope.
4. Services? Nope.
5. Products and Support? Nope.
6. Training? Nope.
7. User Group? Nope.
8. Rules? Nope.
 Me, thinking... "OK. Now where? Most likely, the SSW company description will list it..."
9. Navigates to About Us.
10. Me, scrolls down… nothing.
 Me, thinking... "OK. Weird. Let's go back."
11. Me, goes back to homepage.
 Me, thinking… "Is there a site map?"
12. Scrolls to bottom of page. Clicks sitemap link.
 Me, thinking... "Ctrl+F for TV? Nope."
13. Me, gives up… types tv.ssw.com.au to try and get lucky. Huzzah!

Figure: Good example - We can easily identify more the one way to improve the UX
Better than a good description of the bug is a screen recording. This should be followed for a more detailed report. Use [Snagit](http&#58;//www.techsmith.com/snagit.html) (preferred) or [Jing](http&#58;//www.techsmith.com/jing.html)  to record your screen.

 
Figure: Good example - Recording bug reports in a video can make the issue clearer to see
