 ​​​​​When reporting bugs and giving product feedback, it is essential that you are as descriptive as possible, so that the developer can reproduce the error to find out what the problem is or understand what features you are requesting



Try to have one email per bug​/suggestion, but if the bugs/suggestions are related or very small (e.g. they are all on the same page) then you should group them together in a single email.​

   </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example - This email isn't going to help the developer much - it is vague and has no screen capture, and gives no alternate way for the developer to contact the user regarding the issue</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img src="/SiteAssets/do-you-know-the-right-way-to-report-bugs/do-you-know-the-right-way-to-report-bugs-good-example.png" alt="do-you-know-the-right-way-to-report-bugs-good-example.png" style="width&#58;800px;"> <br> 
   </dt><dd>Figure&#58;&#160;Good Example - This email includes the product name and version, the category of the issue (BUG), a screen capture and contact number, and shows that the user's system is up to date</dd> <br> </dl>

Writing detailed emails like the above can be very time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, it is always a good idea to use a template to make sending quality bug reports quick and easy. A great example is the [Functional Bug template](https&#58;//github.com/aspnet/Home/wiki/Functional-bug-template) from the ASP.NET open source project.


Also, make sure your descriptions are detailed and useful as that can make finding the solution quicker and easier.



Make sure you always explain and give as many details as you can of how you got an error or a bad experience.

Better than a good description of the bug is a screen recording. This should be followed for a more detailed report. Use [Snagit](http&#58;//www.techsmith.com/snagit.html) (preferred) or [Jing](http&#58;//www.techsmith.com/jing.html) to record your screen.
