 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 
Select a "[Product Owner](/Standards/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/WhoHasAuthority.aspx)" - who is the sole person able to make scope decisions and authorize work.
 &lt;&gt;Remember it's all too tempting to allow the DBA to authorise work without seeking proper authority, so insist that your software consultants follow [the standard on getting work approved](/Standards/Management/RulesToHappyClients/Pages/DoYouGetWorkApprovedBeforeYouDoIt.aspx) through a Product Owner.
