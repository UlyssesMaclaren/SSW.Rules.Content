<span class='intro'> There are lots of stakeholders in a software project. Users, Marketing, Managers, they all have requirements for the new system but if the spec becomes a free-for-all, it is more likely the project will be steered off-course.  </span>

<p>Select a &quot;<a href="/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/WhoHasAuthority.aspx">Product Owner</a>&quot; - who is the sole person able to make scope decisions and authorize work. </p>
<p>Remember it's all too tempting to allow the DBA to authorise work without seeking proper authority, so insist that your software consultants follow <a href="/Management/RulesToHappyClients/Pages/DoYouGetWorkApprovedBeforeYouDoIt.aspx">the standard on getting work approved</a> through a Product Owner.</p>
