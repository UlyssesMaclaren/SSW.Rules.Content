During a sprint it can be useful for:

- The Product Owner to know who to speak to regarding a User Story.
- The Team to know who will be presenting the User Story at the Sprint Review


In order to achieve this, one of the Team can choose to be the primary contact for the user story. 


Beware, this is intended for convenience and should not conflict with the following Scrum principals from page 6 of the [Scrum Guide](/Pages/Scrumguide.aspx)

- The Development team is self-organising.
- Accountability belongs to the development team as a whole

**Figure: Good example, the product owner can now see who he should speak to and developers know where to send done emails.**
