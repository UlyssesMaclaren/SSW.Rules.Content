Why do people always invent ways of getting the same old server name and a database name? Look at this image from [Speed Ferret](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/DeveloperGeneral/SQLservertools.aspx#SpeedFerret) - one of my favorite SQL Server utilities.

While a nice form, it would have taken quite some developer time to get it right. Not only that, it is a little bit different than what a user has seen before. Now look at this UDL from one of our utilities [SSW SQL Auditor](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/SQLAuditor/):

Every developer has seen this before - so use it. Better still, it is only a few lines of code: [B-Open UDL Dialog-DH.txt](https://gist.github.com/SSWConsulting/60cce3f7a65665d7dae2#file-b-open-udl-dialog-dh)

#### Exception

The above cannot be used when you want the user to create a new database. Microsoft does not supply an out of the box UI and there is no third party solution. Only in this case you have to create your own form.
