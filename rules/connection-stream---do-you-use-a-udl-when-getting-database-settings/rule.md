Why do people always invent ways of getting the same old server name and a database name? Look at this image from [Speed Ferret](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/DeveloperGeneral/SQLservertools.aspx#SpeedFerret) - one of my favorite SQL Server utilities.
   â€‹<dl class="badImage"><dt><img alt="Custom database connection screen " src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/CustomDatabaseConnectionScreen.jpg"></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example - Custom database connection screen in Speed Ferret</dd></dl>
While a nice form, it would have taken quite some developer time to get it right. Not only that it is a little bit different than what a user has seen before. Now look at this UDL from one of our utilities [SSW SQL Auditor](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/SQLAuditor):
<dl class="goodImage"><dt><img alt="Standard Microsoft UDL dialog" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/StandardMSUDLDialog.jpg"></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - Standard Microsoft UDL dialog</dd></dl>
Every developer has seen this before - so use it. Better still, it is only a few lines of code: [B-Open UDL Dialog-DH.txt](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/KB/Codebase/05VB-Net/B-Open%20UDL%20Dialog-DH.txt) 
<dl class="image"><dt><img alt=" Visual Studio .NET 2005 Microsoft are yet to release an API" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/ReleaseAPI.jpg"></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; Coming in Visual Studio .NET 2005 Microsoft are yet to release an API to do this</dd></dl>

#### Exception

The above cannot be used when you want the user to create a new database. Microsoft does not supply an out of the box UI and there is no third party solution. Only in this case you have to create your own form.
<dl class="image"><dt><img alt="SQL Deploy uses its own custom form " src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/SQLDeploy.jpg"></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; SQL Deploy uses its own custom form for &quot;selecting&quot; a database name</dd></dl>
