Your event must have a registration area clearly signed and easily identifiable. ​​
 
Further, your registration process should be efficient and simple. What has worked well at DDD Melbourne is

- Have enough people ready for registration first thing in the morning. More is more.
- Be able to find individual name tags and/or welcome packages quickly. Sorting alphabetically could be useful.
- Have a clear entry and exit so people aren't creating a bottleneck
- Use only electronic registration (apps and devices) where it improves the speed of the process.


Attendees will go to the registration area to register (if applicable) and they will go here to have any questions answered as well. A registration area should be

- Clearly visible – Put up adequate signage and announce where the​ area is
- Always manned – registration should have permanent staff there to help any attendees that require it at any time
- Be at a central location, but not in the way of where people are walking
