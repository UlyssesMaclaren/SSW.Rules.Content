You should design a website to look good when being viewed in the latest version of Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Safari and Google Chrome unless the client specifically requests otherwise.

There are a lot of other browsers available, but it is important to consider that most other browsers are based on the most used browser nowadays.
 
Note that readable is not perfect. There may be some page elements that are less than perfect, but it's just not worth of time to fix small bugs on every single browser.


You must test your website on the major browsers, though, because that there will be more differences and problems than you would think. The typical things that you will need to fix are:

- Menus
- Dynamic HTML
- VB Script


You should be able to fix all formatting and layout bugs editing the CSS file.
