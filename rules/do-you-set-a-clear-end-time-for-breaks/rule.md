 When you set a break at a training course, you should make sure you’re first make sure your finish what you are doing. Don’t cut people off because of a clock.   Tell them 20 min break (or 1 hour for lunch) and: 
- Let them break
- Write in a clear place the end time for the break and ask people to be back on time<br><dl>    <dt><img src="/Communication/RulesToBetterTraining/PublishingImages/break-ends.jpg" alt="Break ends" class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea"> </dt>
    <dd class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Clearly show the end time for the break - print the <a href="/Communication/RulesToBetterTraining/Documents/break-ends-sheet.pdf">PDF here</a></dd>
<dd class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal"><span style="font-size&#58;12px;font-weight&#58;normal;line-height&#58;21px;"></span></dd></dl>
- ​Set an alarm on your phone or PC

- If anyone comes back late – Explain the value of integrity. Honouring your word in small things makes it easier to honour it for the larger things, such as doing your best in a sprint, and makes people believe in you more
