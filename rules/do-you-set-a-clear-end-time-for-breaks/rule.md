 When you set a break at a training course, you should make sure you’re first make sure your finish what you are doing. Don’t cut people off because of a clock.   Tell them 20 min break (or 1 hour for lunch) and: 
- Let them break
- Write in a clear place the end time for the break and ask people to be back on time<br>![Break ends](/Communication/RulesToBetterTraining/PublishingImages/break-ends.jpg) Figure: Clearly show the end time for the break - print the [PDF here](/Communication/RulesToBetterTraining/Documents/break-ends-sheet.pdf)
- ​Set an alarm on your phone or PC

- If anyone comes back late – Explain the value of integrity. Honouring your word in small things makes it easier to honour it for the larger things, such as doing your best in a sprint, and makes people believe in you more
