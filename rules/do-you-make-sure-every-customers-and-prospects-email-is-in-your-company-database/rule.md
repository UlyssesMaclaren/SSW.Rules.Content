<br>Most companies keep all their customers' (and prospects') contact information in a database (e.g. SQL Server, Access, Oracle). This allows all staff to easily locate contact details about a particular person. So when you get an email, make sure you check that email address and itÂ is in the company database.<br> 

<br>We have a program called [SSW LookOut! for Outlook](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/LookOut/) to check for this rule. ![Stephen Koop not in database](/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/StephenKoopIsNotInTheDatabase.jpg) Figure: Stephen Koop needs to be put into the database
![Not in database](/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/NotInDatabase.gif) Figure: SSW Lookout! Can also check the emails that you are sending and tell you if the email address is not in your database.
