<span class='intro'> Enter Intro Text<br> </span>

<p>When setting up Zendesk you want to add users to groups. Groups allow you to allocate a group of people to a particular task or activity. One group may be responsible for many tasks or activities.&#160;</p><p>The benefits of using groups is when someone leaves the company or changes responsibilities. You can remove or add them to the&#160;corresponding group and they will automatically be added or removed from all&#160;the activities that group is responsible.<br><br></p>
