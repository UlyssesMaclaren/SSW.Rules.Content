When something happens in your company, always send around an email so that the                     whole team is kept in the loop.
 
Examples of events that you should send an email                     around for:

- An update to a company standard or procedure (including a link to it)
- Births and marriages
- Employees who are starting or finishing
- Anything significant that is happening in your life or the life of a loved one


You should really feel free to share any good news you have with everyone. It will                     make the office feel more like a family and not just a place to turn up to work.
