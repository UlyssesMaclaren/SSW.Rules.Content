Make sure appointments have address details unless it's obvious for all attendees.

<!--endintro-->

[[badExample]]
| ![Appointment field should have addresses in location when appropriate](appointment-location-bad-example.jpg)

[[goodExample]]
| ![Address is clearly identified in the location field, meaning it can be mapped using applications on smartphones](map example.png)

It's important to always add the address information in appointments when a third party is included. i.e.:

* A client meeting at your location
* A meeting at the client location


The exception is for internal meeting appointments:

You should invite a coworker to work with you in the boardroom (but not include the address)
