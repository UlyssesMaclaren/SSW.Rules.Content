 When you are on leave, you need to make sure that your mailbox is monitored. The best way to do this is by either: <br>
 
- For extended periods off the​ grid, asking someone (nicely) to check your mailbox if you are away for 3 days or more. This ensures that any important emails from clients are actioned,
- Make sure all client emails are handled before you leave; either delegate the task, or inform the person taking care of your inbox or,
- Check it yourself every 3-4 days from home or wherever you are (a Hawaiian beach or Himalayan mountain maybe!).  People are generally okay waiting a couple of days for a reply.

Figure: Avoid using the Outlook Out of Office Assistant - This can fill up your clients' mailboxes with annoying auto-**replies**.

The use of 'Out of Office - Automated Response​' emails is avoided at SSW as they can clog up the clients' inboxes - they are considered to be annoying! For example, John gets lots of emails from many different people within the same organisation.  Each of those people will be spammed about his holiday!

When you expect to have partial connectivity and anticipate replying, don't set your Out of Office on at all.

**For extended periods off the grid, the use of Out of Office is good.**
