 When you are on leave, you need to make sure that your mailbox is monitored. I find the best way to do this is by either:<br> 
- Asking someone (nicely) to check your mailbox if you are away for 3 days or more. This ensures that any important emails from clients are actioned or,
- Check it yourself every 3-4 days from home or wherever you are (Hawaii maybe!)

Figure: Avoid using the Outlook Out of Office Assistant - This can fill up your clients' mailboxes with annoying auto-replies
 We do not use 'Out of Office - Automated Response' emails as they can clog up the clients' inboxes - they are considered to be annoying! For example, John gets 300 emails a week, if he goes away for 2 weeks and sets his auto-reply on, that's 600 auto-replies!
