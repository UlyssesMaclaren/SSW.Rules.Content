If you use a Team per client, it is likely that you want to have a link between your Teams instances and the associated CRM record.
 
At SSW we have a custom property for each client that stores the Teams URL:

![Live CRM | Company/Account Form â€“ added Teams URL field](live-crm.jpg)
To get that URL, simply click the ellipsis next to your Team name and click "Get link to Team"

![get the Teams URL](get-teams-url.jpg)
This process can even be automated using Azure functions and Graph API to provision a new Team every time a new client is created in CRM.
