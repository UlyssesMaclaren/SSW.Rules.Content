Not explicitly specifying the access type for members of a structure or class can be deceiving for other developers that are using this structure or class. The default structure and class members access in Visual C# .NET is always private. The default class member access in Visual Basic .NET is private. However, the default structure member access in Visual Basic .NET is public.

We have a program calledÂ [SSW Code Auditor](https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Rules.aspx#Interoper) to check for this rule.
