Imagine someone wants an appointment with a team member who has [shared their calendar](/Management/Rules-to-Better-Software-Consultants-Working-in-a-Team/Pages/Share-your-calendar-with-everyone.aspx) with you. Offer to look up the calendar and book in time straightaway.
 Try calling him.<br>                                            Bad Example                    Sure, I'll just look up Adam's calendar and see when he's free.<br>                                            Good Example
