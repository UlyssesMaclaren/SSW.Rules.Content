Imagine someone wants an appointment with a team member who has [shared their calendar](/Pages/Know-the-ways-to-share-and-see-calendars.aspx) with you. Offer to look up the calendar and book in time straightaway.
 Try calling him.<br>                                            Bad Example

                    Sure, I'll just look up Adam's calendar and see when he's free. Obviously it's not a good idea to call Adam now as he is on a plane.                         Good Example
