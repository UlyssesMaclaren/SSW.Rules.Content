 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 
Of course any important chats should be [confirmed via email](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulestoBetterInstantMessenger.aspx#ConfirmImportantChatsEmail).

Hey Simon

I find having my clients available on Windows Live Messenger (Instant Messenger/MSN) is extremely useful. Are you on Messenger? If so, can I please add you as a contact? I'll add the above email address, let me know if you use a different one.

Cheers

Figure: It's easy to get your clients on Instant Messenger, you only have to ask!
