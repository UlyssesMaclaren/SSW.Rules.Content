<span class='intro'> <p>â€‹
                    Whenever you need a number from a system you should think of how you can create a report, so next time you can press a button to get the result.</p> </span>

<p>If you find yourself doing adhoc reports, or random SQL queries you should make sure the boss knows you could not find the data you needed.</p>
                    <dl class="goodImage">
                    <dt>
                        <img alt="Eg. Email your boss to ask a number" src="/PublishingImages/CreateReport.JPG" />
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Figure&#58; Sample Email -- Send an email to your boss for a number. 
                    </dd>
                </dl>
