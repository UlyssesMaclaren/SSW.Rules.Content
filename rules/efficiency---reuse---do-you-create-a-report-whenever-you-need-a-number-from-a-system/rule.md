Whenever you need a number from a system you should think of how you can create a report, so next time you can press a button to get the result.
 
If you found yourself doing ad-hoc reports, or random SQL queries, a few years ago, the best thing to do was to make sure the boss knows you could not find the data you needed, so he could comission a new report to be built.

Since 2015, the best practice is instead to jump into Power BI and build the report yourself.

You can see in Ulysses' video how Power BI is the best tool for this: [https://tv.ssw.com/6839/power-bi-finally-can-make-decisions-based-facts-ulysses-maclaren](https&#58;//tv.ssw.com/6839/power-bi-finally-can-make-decisions-based-facts-ulysses-maclaren)​
