â€‹                     Whenever you need a number from a system you should think of how you can create a report, so next time you can press a button to get the result.
 
If you find yourself doing adhoc reports, or random SQL queries you should make sure the boss knows you could not find the data you needed.
![Eg. Email your boss to ask a number](/Management/Rules-to-Better-Software-Consultants-Working-in-a-Team/PublishingImages/CreateReport.JPG)                        Figure: Sample Email -- Send an email to your boss for a number. <br>
