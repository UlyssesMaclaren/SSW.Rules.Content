**Figure: Sample Change Request Confirmation email **


So, say Alan from Accounts would like the Username and Password authentication to have a "remember me" checkbox for the Accounts module. This sounds reasonable, but it doesn't mean that you should charge right in and start coding.

As an example, this is how we govern this process:

- At the beginning of the project one of the client staff is assigned as Company Champion. This person has full authority from the Business Decision Maker of the client as to what work is IN or OUT. Every new item of work must be authorized by this Company Champion.
- Whenever someone who ISN'T the Company Champion makes a request for work, the Company Champion must be CC'd. If Mary the receptionist has not done this, the developer sends the email again to himself, and CC's the Company Champion (CC'ing other relevant people - if they may give feedback on the task) to let them know about the request.
- We make the assumption that the task is good to go, so it is the Company Champion's job to make sure that they reply ASAP if they don't want the problem fixed.
