A web page should not be more than 4 levels deep. Use a       drop-down menu to help users get to these pages quicker. For       larger site, you may want to consider mega dropdown menu.

There is no point of having a web page if it is too hard for       the user to access from the main menu or from multiple links       on your site.

It is important to remember that Menu links are intended as shortcuts to pages, while Breadcrumbs are "where am I?"
