<span class='intro'> Restoration is vital, we all agree. But rapid restoration with minimal down time is just as important. Run practice restorations on a regular basis, as you don't want to find out that your back-up doesn't restore when a problem has already occurred.<br>This restoration process is so important that you should have a termination clause in an employee's contract if the restore doesn't work when something goes wrong.â€‹<br> </span>
