Make sure appointments have address details unless it's obvious for all attendees.

It's important to always add the address information in appointments when a third party is included. ie:

- A client meeting at your location
- A meeting at the client location


The exception is for internal meeting appointments:


I would invite Zune to work Saturday @ SSW (but not include the address)
