  <p>My Father-in-Law is Greek and I have noticed he gets more out of a tradesman than anyone else. Bottom line is he watches what they're doing and then gets on their case early when things aren't perfect. Whether it's carpet layers not matching the patterns together or plasterers leaving unsightly corners - as soon as he spots a problem he confronts them straight away and gets them to rectify it. </p>
<p>With any professional consultant or tradesman you should always take a hands-on approach with the project, stay on top of the important issues, and be ready to get involved when you see a problem. </p>
<p>Of course, as your relationship builds with the consultant or tradesman, and they become more aware of your expectations, you can divulge greater trust and leave them to it. </p>
<p>So you should insist that your software consultants <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulestoSuccessfulProjects.aspx#verbalcontact">maintain verbal contact</a> with you.</p>
