When you seek advice or help from another, firstly, you need to establish with them:  
- Your understanding and,
- Methods you have previously attempted in order to resolve the problem


Tip: Be aware that you don't want them to reply with http://www.lmgtfy.com

or the bing version [http://letmebingthatforyou.com](http://letmebingthatforyou.com/) :-)
![ Bad Example - By not stating what you have previously attempted to resolve the problem, the person you are seeking advice from may be wasting time if they suggest methods you have already done.I have searched Google but no luck... How do you xxxx? ](../../assets/ImIcon.jpg) How do you xxxx?
