 Making sure that your site content to include specific keywords is just one part of the story. You need to constantly monitor how they perform. ​
 
The two main tools for keywords (and most of SEO research) are:

- [ahrefs.com](http&#58;//ahrefs.com/)
- [semrush.com](http&#58;//semrush.com/)


It's better to use paid versions, but there are free versions with a limited set of features that are still useful.
