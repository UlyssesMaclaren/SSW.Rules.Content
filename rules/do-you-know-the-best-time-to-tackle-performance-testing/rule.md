Performance, load and stress testing should be tackled after you have confirmed that everything works functionally (usually after UX testing). Performance testing should only be after daily errors are down to zero (reported by Application Insights or Raygun). This way you can be sure that any functional issues that occur during performance tests are scaling issues.
