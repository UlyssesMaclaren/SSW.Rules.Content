 If the task requires a code change and you are using TFS, make sure it goes in as a work item. 
<br>The perfect workflow is to use TeamCompanion and get nice email integration, as per ["Rules to better Project Management with TFS"](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterProjectManagementWithTFS.aspx#SendDoneMail)
