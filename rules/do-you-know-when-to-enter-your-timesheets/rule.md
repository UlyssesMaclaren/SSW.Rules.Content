The easiest way to remember to enter your timesheets is to have a routine. If it works for you to enter your timesheet at the end of each day, that's great, otherwise:

- Every Friday:
    1. If you are in the office enter them into your timesheeting system
    2. If you are working on-site and you have VPN access or web services, enter your times directly into your timesheeting system
    3. If you don't have VPN access and web services are not working, email your timesheets to your manager
- It's good to do this straight after lunch, so as not to interrupt your flow, but, as a deadline, they should be done by 5pm, andÂ any changes that occur on Friday, Saturday or Sunday, must happen by Sunday night.
- The purpose of this is so that your accounts team can check all timesheets and invoice the clients first thing on Monday morning.
- You may want to have a [reward system](/Management/Rules-to-Better-Timesheets/Pages/reward-your-employees-for-doing-their-timesheets.aspx)in place to ensure this always happens
