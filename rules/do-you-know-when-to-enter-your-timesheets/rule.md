- At the end of each day, you need to get your timesheets signed by your client or manager at 6pm.
- You must enter your timesheets into your hard copy diary every day.
- Before close of business every Friday:
    1. If you are in the office enter them into your timesheeting system
    2. If you are working on-site and you have VPN access or web services, enter your times directly into your timesheeting system
    3. If you don't have VPN access and web services are not working, email your timesheets to your manager
- As a deadline, you should enter timesheets at 5pm on Friday, any changes to that on Friday, Saturday or Sunday, must happen by Sunday night.
