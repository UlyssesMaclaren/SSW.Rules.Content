Some people like popup forms. Some do not.

Popup modal forms are no good:

- as you can't read or edit something else in a window behind
- as they take a lot of time to load in a browser (ask any CRM 4 user)

   â€‹
Popup forms are good:

- as it is obvious you have an action step to perform before continuing
- as they simplify a form that has lots of fields
- if they can't get lost behind another window
- if you make them clear by dimming the background (see below)

<dd>Figure&#58; Bad example - if this was a popup form it would be easier to focus on where to look (as a minimum you would be looking at half the screen)</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img alt="Adobe Illustrator" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/Popup02.jpg"></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; Good example - the popup with the dimmed background is much more intuitive</dd></dl>
For example, adding a webpart in SharePoint 2010 should use a popup form. [See our suggestion to Microsoft](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/BetterSoftwareSuggestions/sharepoint.aspx#PopupForm).
