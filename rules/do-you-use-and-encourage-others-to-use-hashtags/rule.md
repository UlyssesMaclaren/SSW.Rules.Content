<span class='intro'> Hashtags identify the keyword&#160;or&#160;topic&#160;of&#160;interest&#160;that the post is about. They allow searching&#160;for&#160;similar posts on the topic. They were popularized on twitter and now work on&#160;Facebook, Pinterest, and Google+. On twitter, it is possible to &quot;track&quot; (aka Subscribe)&#160;a tag.&#160; <br> </span>
