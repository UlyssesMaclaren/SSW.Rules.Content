You should use virtualized standalone servers because:

- If one server goes down it does not affect other servers (e.g. a centralized SQL server fails and brings down: CRM, TFS, Reports, Web Server)
- You can just copy the VPC to another computer and it just works, no need to worry about reconfiguring the SQL connection string or web services
- You can just backup the VPC


However, you should scale out your servers if:

- You want the best performance (e.g. A different server for SQL backend and Web frontend)
