+1 on this. It can be quite frustrating.

Subject: Rule files
Hi,
 
I saw two clients today that complained about Rule files being created even though one had already existed. They were all named x.SSWCodeAuditor where x was a number from 1 to 13 in one of the cases.
 
Why do these keep being created?
