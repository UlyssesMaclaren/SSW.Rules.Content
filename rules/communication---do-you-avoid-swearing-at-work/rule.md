<span class='intro'> <p>Swearing is not acceptable at work.&#160;</p><p>A good deterrent is to enforce&#160;ten&#160;push-ups for every infraction. This is the same concept as a swear jar but also promotes fitness.&#160;​</p><p>If nobody paid attention to this rule,&#160;people would get comfortable with
                    bad language and the work environment would suffer.
