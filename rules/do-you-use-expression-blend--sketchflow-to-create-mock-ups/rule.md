<span class='intro'> 
  <p>Mock-ups are very powerful tools to communicate requirements with clients, however it could be very time consuming and costing to create a good looking mock-up. Also, we don't want to &quot;create and throw&quot; our mock-ups, they should be picked up by developers and add features on top of them once the client approves the work. <br>
<br>
Using Expression + SketchFlow, you can</p>
<ul>
    <li>Quickly create sketch-style mock-ups with little efforts, </li>
    <li>Share your mock-ups with the whole team and clients easily, </li>
    <li>Collect feedbacks from clients, </li>
    <li>Use them in development process directly (as they are real Sliverlight and WPF solution files) </li>
</ul>
