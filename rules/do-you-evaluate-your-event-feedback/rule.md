​​​​​After the event it is also critical that you analyse the feedback. Why else would you be gathering it? ​​
 
​Look for trends in the data and evaluate what you can do better next time and what you should possibly leave out. ​​​​

​You should then send a retrospective email to relevant team members, and let them know how you feel the event went, and ask for their​ feedback.

Remember to include important feedback like:



- ​Any great comments from the evaluation forms
- Any not so great feedback from the evaluation forms
- Points for improvement
- Stats on the free demand generation (how 'Go​o​gleable' is your event)
- Stats on the paid demand generation (if applicable)
- The demand generation of the speaker (for example did they Tweet your event & what engagement did it​ get)
