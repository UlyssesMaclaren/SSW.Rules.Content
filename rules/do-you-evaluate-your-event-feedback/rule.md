<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">After the event it is also critical that you analyse the feedback. Why else would you be gathering it?&#160;​​</p> </span>

<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​Look for trends in the data and evaluate what you can do better next time and what you should possibly leave out.&#160;​​​​</p>
