In Outlook, the Calendar control has a number of important features:

- Saturday and Sunday are displayed at the *end*.
- Days that have data associated with them are **bold**
- The current day is highlighted with a box

 
â€‹

Users are familiar with the Outlook calendar control. When the calendar control                      is used it should incorporate all of these features of the Outlook calendar                      control.
