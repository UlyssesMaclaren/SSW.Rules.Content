The repository pattern is a great way to handle your data access layer and should be used wherever you have a need to retrieve data and turn it into business objects.
 
Even better, by providing a consistent repository base class, you can get all your CRUD operations while avoiding any plumbing code.

See [this blog post](http&#58;//brdy.in/xqrAFb)Â by Damian Brady for an example of how to implement a repository pattern for Entity Framework.
