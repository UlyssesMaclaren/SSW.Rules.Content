<span class='intro'> <p>The repository pattern is a great way to handle your data access layer and should be used wherever you have a need to retrieve data and turn it into business objects.</p> </span>

<p>Even better, by providing a consistent repository base class, you can get all your CRUD operations while avoiding any plumbing code.</p>
<p>See <a href="http&#58;//brdy.in/xqrAFb">this blog post</a>&#160;by Damian Brady for an example of how to implement a repository pattern for Entity Framework.</p>
