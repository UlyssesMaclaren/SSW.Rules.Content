General web content should always be written as if read by a newsreader. It is objective and describes its content professionally. A good example of this is Wikipedia. 
[[badExample | using 1st person writing makes it sound like opinion]]
|                               I don't like JavaScript. I prefer jQuery because...
[[goodExample | using 3rd person writing makes it sound like fact]]
|                               jQuery is superior to JavaScript for this because...
However, when quoting a testimonial, you should use 1st person writing as if a newsreader had crossed over to an eyewitness for a personal view of the topic.

[[badExample | impersonal]]
|                               Don Bradman thought that SSW's work was fantastic!
[[goodExample | 1st person in this context is appropriate]]
|                               Don Bradman says: "I thought that SSW's work was fantastic!"
