  <p>Sometimes clients will add attachment files into emails. Those files could be documents or images, which may contain details or solutions of the issue, or some helpful information.<br>
To keep the history, it is very important to embed the attachment files into the email since it's easy to lose those files when responding. </p>

<font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal" size="+0">Figure&#58; The image is in attachment. </font><br>

PS&#58; Clients make attachments because they are using OWA and you can't paste an image in - see suggestion for OWA </p>
