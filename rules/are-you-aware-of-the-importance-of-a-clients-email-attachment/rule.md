Sometimes clients will add attachment files into emails. Those files could be documents or images, which may contain details or solutions of the issue, or some helpful information.
<br>To keep the history, it is very important to embed the attachment files into the email since it's easy to lose those files when responding.<br>

 PS: Clients make attachments because they are using OWA and you can't paste an image in - see suggestion for OWA
