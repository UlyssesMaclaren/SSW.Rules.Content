 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 
The best way for this to work is to break tasks into the smallest possible [bit size pieces](/Standards/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/SpecinBiteSizePieces.aspx) and ensure that those pieces are in the project plan explicitly.

Sometimes software developers miss a related item which you might consider 'blindingly obvious.' For example you might ask them to fix a combo box on one form in a legacy application. But they mightn't know about the three other forms that the same type of combo appears on. So if you also want them fixed, then let them know about them!

Insist your software consultants [conduct specifications by creating mock-ups](/Standards/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/SpecificationByMockUp.aspx).
