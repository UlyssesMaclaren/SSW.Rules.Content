Here’s a little thing to keep in mind, as Google Ads has a limitation in characters. The Ads character limits are as follows:
 
- **Headline 1**  – 30 Character Maximum
- **Headline 2**  – 30 Character Maximum
- **Description Line**  – 90 Character Maximum
- **Display URL**  – 35 Character Maximum
- **Final URL** – 1024 Character Maximum


Main Key metrics to follow (depending on your strategy):

- CPC
- CPA
- CTR
- Average position
