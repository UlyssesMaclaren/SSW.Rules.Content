When designing your form, you should try to help your user whenever it's possible. So it's a good idea to include the number of results in ComboBoxes.

Long text boxes &gt; 30 entries, another approach can be employed - putting the common ones at the top![Long Text ComboBox](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/Rule38LongTextCombobox.jpg)Figure: Bad Example - Firstly because it is manual, plus what about the 4th, 5th, etc most common used countries![Sortable ComboBox](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/rule38SortableCombobox.jpg)Figure: Bad Example – This was a highly unpopular method of the sorting and counting above
We believe all combos should be able to be sorted ascending/descending and by popularity asc/desc.
