<span class='intro'> <p>​
                    Receiving positive feedback makes everyone feel good. Forgetting to recognize success
                    means the team has no motivation to succeed.
                <br></p> </span>

<p>
                    This is a simple rule - if someone goes beyond the call of duty, you thank them.
