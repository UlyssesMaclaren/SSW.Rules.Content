​​Hashtags (#) are used when talking about something – a topic or keyword. Using a hashtag creates a link that leads to a page displaying an aggregated list of posts about that thing. 




On the other hand, @mentions are used when talking to or about someone (the user account of a person, brand, group, etc.). The link created by a @mention goes to that user account. The user is notified when they have received a @mention in a post so that they can respond. 



 
**Small companies/topics:
**If the brand is big you don't need it diluted. So use the @ not the #
eg.  @firebootcamp is preferred over #firebootcamp

**Large companies/topics:**

If the brand is big you will see a difference between the @ and the #. So if you want to tweet about a subject that is also a username – such as #VisualStudio / @VisualStudio - then the content of your tweet will decide whether to use a hashtag or a @mention: 


- If you are talking to someone directly, or mention a specific user in your tweet, you should use the @mention.
Eg. Thanks to @visualstudio for the map to Bill Gates’s house – I’m looting his safe right now!
- 
- If it is about the topic, then the hashtag is the way to go.
Eg. Microsoft releases #VisualStudio 2013 Update 2​
