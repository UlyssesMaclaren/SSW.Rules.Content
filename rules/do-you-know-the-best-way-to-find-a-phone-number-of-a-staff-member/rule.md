Bad way: use the Global Address List in Active Directory, because you canâ€™t update it from Outlook... Only an administrator can maintain the details
 Note: good UI as it is easy to find inside outlook

Good way: use CRM4 toolbar?
 Note: We have a suggestion that Outlook should allow you to put the CRM4 URL into Tools | Options so this is better integrated
