<br>How often have you clicked "Send" and then wished you hadn't? It's a common problem. It can be easily solved by un-checking the "Send Immediately When Connected" option in Tools/ Options/ Mail Setup. I guarantee this will save you, one day!<br> ![Outlook Send Immediately](/Standards/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/OutlookSendImmediately.gif) Figure: Don't send emails immediately - you will often remember something you needed to add

We have a program called [SSW LookOut! for Outlook](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/LookOut/) to check for this rule. It checks your Outlook settings and tell you if it's not set properly.![Contact or Send Immediately](/Standards/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/ContactorSendImmediately.GIF) Figure: SSW LookOut! for Outlook warns you if Outlook is set to send emails immediately
