Whether you are converting an email to a blog post or writing it from scratch, always invite and instruct discussion. <br>
 ![ Bad example, there are no instructions here![SNAGHTMLef6f69](RulesBloggingFeedbackGood.jpg "SNAGHTMLef6f69")](RulesBloggingFeedbackBad.jpg "SNAGHTMLf1a9ab")
Although people may not comply, it helps them adjust from the world of email only.
