 Wither you are converting an email to a blog post or writing it from scratch, always invite and instruct discussion. <br>

<font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureBad" size="+0">Figure&#58; Bad example, there are no instructions here</font>

<font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood" size="+0">Figure&#58; Good example&#160;â€“ Asking some questions at the end will solicit more feedback</font>

Although people may not comply, it helps them adjust from the world of email only.
