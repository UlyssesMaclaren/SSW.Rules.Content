Spaces should be avoided. If an object name contains a space, it can cause problems later on for developers because the developer must remember to put the object name inside square brackets when referencing it.

[Why avoid reserved words and spaces in object names?](https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/KB/KB.asp?KBID=Q1620415)
 
We aim to never have to use square brackets in any of our databases.
