<span class='intro'> The Jira rules were somewhat outdated by the upgrade to Jira 4 that changed the dashboard functionality significantly.&#160; They have not been updated yet and we await a decision on how much effort it is worth expending before any changees commence.&#160;<div>I had to make this note a new rule as I could not see a way of adding a note&#160;to the site without changing the title. 
</div> </span>
