Sometimes it can be hard to keep generating content daily for your social media, and even more when there’s not much going on.

<!--endintro-->

So, here are a few examples taken from our social media of what you could post on yours:

### Internal projects, services or products that your business developed or offers

### Projects that your company worked on
