The best way to show the features of a product is creating a video. The information you are able to communicate in seconds of a video would take hundreds of words of text to explain.

Videos are also important for services, but for products it should beÂ **in the homepage**.
 ![Dropbox homepage](/PublishingImages/dropbox-homepage.jpg)[Good Example - Dropbox homepage](https&#58;//www.dropbox.com/) ![](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/images/external.gif "You are now leaving SSW") has no text but a video that shows nicely how it works
#### Videos are also good for SEO

By embedding videos onto your website it will help get the videos more views, which is a determinant for Google nowadays.
