The best way to show the features of a product is creating a video. The information you are able to communicate in seconds of a video would take hundreds of words of text to explain.

Videos are also important for services, but for products, it should be **on the homepage**.

By embedding videos onto your website it will help get the videos more views, which is a determinant for Google nowadays.
