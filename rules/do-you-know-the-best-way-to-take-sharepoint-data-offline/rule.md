 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field).   We think the best way is to use Workspace instead of Outlook:

1. SharePoint Workspace synchronize an entire site
<br>    a. So when lists are renamed it knows about it.
<br>    b. It also knows about new lists that are added to a SharePoint site<br>    ![](/Standards/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterSharePoint/PublishingImages/Synchronize.jpg)Figure: SharePoint Workspace synchronizing an entire site
2. Outlook can be quite busy when synchronizing to Exchange server; it is good to not burden it with more work.

 While SharePoint Workspace is quite good, we donâ€™t like to store lists in it:

1. Access has better filtering, sorting options when offline<br>
