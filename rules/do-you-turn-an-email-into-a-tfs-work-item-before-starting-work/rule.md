<span class='intro'> If a product owner sends an email to the development team with a request, that email should be turned into a TFS Work Item before any work is started or the work is prioritized on the backlog.  If you’re using Team Companion, this is easily done with the New Work Item from Mail button. </span>

   <strong>Note&#58;</strong> Once you've moved the email into TFS as work item, you should delete the original email from your inbox or move it to a outlook folder called &quot;Moved to TFS&quot; to avoid duplication.</p><p>It is just as important to let the client know that a request has been turned into a Work Item.</p><p>Using Team Companion, you can navigate to the appropriate Work Item and click the Send button.  This will let you send an email to the Product Owner with the details of the Work Item including a link to the work item in Web Access.</p><dl class="image"><dt>
