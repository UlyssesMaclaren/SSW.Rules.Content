You should prefix your sample databases with your company and products. This is so your users can tell easily at a glance what it is for. Sample databases should be named in the following way:

- SSWSQLAuditorNorthwindSample
- SSWSQLTotalCompareNorthwindSamplePub
- SSWSQLTotalCompareNorthwindSampleSub


Sample Access database are named similarly:

- SSWLookOutNorthwindSample2000.mdb
