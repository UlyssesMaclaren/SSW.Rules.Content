<span class='intro'> 
  <p>These controls are similar, but the&#160;DVWP&#160;needs heavier customization&#160;and should be avoided where possible. </p>
<p>The CQWP is easier to style. The&#160;DVWP should only be used if you need one of these features&#58;</p>
<ol>
    <li><span>You only want to search on one column in the list, rather than all the (indexed) columns.</span> </li>
    <li><span>You want to perform a search on multiple lists, but not all the lists on a web.</span> </li>
    <li><span><span>You want to have a very specific Look and Feel that the search results use.<br>
    </span></span></li>
