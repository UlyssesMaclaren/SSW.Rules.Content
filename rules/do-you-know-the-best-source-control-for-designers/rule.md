When it comes to the easiest and quickest<br>way to share files between designers, it should all be done in Dropbox.
 ![ Bad example – TFS takes too long to set up and too slow to use](Designer-Source-Control-TFS.png) 
 ![ Bad Example – What seemed like a great idea at the time, SharePoint and SkyDrive proved to be plagued with slow response times, upload errors and unresponsiveness](Designer-Source-Control-SkyDrive.png)

### So why do we prefer Dropbox over OneDrive?


1. **OneDrive (was SkyDrive) requires me to check out the file in SharePoint before I make changes. **    I have to open a web browser, log in to the intranet, check out the file, and then open the file on my computer before I can make edits to it. This is a shocking amount of busy work for something that is already on my computer. I am unable to work directly from the file on my computer and have it sync automatically. I have to check out a file that is ON my computer. Why can I not check out the file from my computer? Why does it not check out the file when I edit it?
    Dropbox lets me work right away on the file on my computer
 ![ OneDrive (was SkyDrive) has no option to "check out" here. I have to go to the browser and check out a file which is on my computer. Better yet, Dropbox doesn't even ask me to check out, it just does it](Designer-Source-Control-SkyDriveCheckout.png) 
2. **For me to check out the file and to upload the file to "SharePoint" I have to be on VPN. **    Our VPN speed is horrible for people outside of Sydney and it takes me the majority of the day to upload 1 Photoshop file. This is unacceptable, because the files designers work with are huge. I.E. those posters of Uly, Mehmet and William are  54MB… EACH.
    I can use Dropbox and have it sync to Tiago, David, without needing to be on VPN. The files are sync'd as I work so they are never out of date, or "waiting to be uploaded"
3. **When OneDrive (was SkyDrive) has an error, it just sits there and pauses my other files until the error is resolved. **    Even if the problem is something like "this file is too big for upload." Somehow one large file prevents my other normal files from being uploaded.
    I have used Dropbox for 3 years and it has never given me an error.
 ![ OneDrive (was SkyDrive) has my last two files just sitting as "upload paused" – these files are perfectly ok to be uploaded but it refuses to do so, even when I ask it to](Designer-Source-Control-SkyDriveUploadPaused.png) 
4. ** OneDrive (was SkyDrive) has strange errors that cannot be resolved. **    For example, in the screenshot below, I have been getting "Upload pending" when I have repeatedly tried to upload the file. I have no idea what OneDrive is doing. The file is checked out in SharePoint, it's a little big but typical of designer files. And yet, OneDrive sits there, doing nothing and throwing me popup messages about the status being updated.
    Dropbox just works.
 ![ In OneDrive (was SkyDrive), my files are stuck in a "Upload pending" loop. I do not know why, as the files have been checked out and are not particularly large](Designer-Source-Control-SkyDriveLoop.png) 
5. ** OneDrive (was SkyDrive) has problems uploading files. **    

    - In the first box, it decided to upload my file as a new file instead of saving the old one as a version
    - In the second box, it **overrode** my file with something that has no file size (probably a broken file.)

    
    Thank god that second file is saved in my Dropbox. Dropbox has never broken my files and it knows how to save files with version tracking.

Of course, Dropbox is not perfect. There is the issue of file size limit, especially as the Share Folder takes up a portion of the individual user's account (this is resolved by upgrading to a [Dropbox Business Account](https://www.dropbox.com/help/59/en)). A free account starts off with only 2GB and this is likely not enough especially as your team's shared folder continues to get bigger.
