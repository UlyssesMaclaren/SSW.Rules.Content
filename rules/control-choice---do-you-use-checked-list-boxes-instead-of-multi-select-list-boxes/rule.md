Multi-select listboxes are the bane of a graphical user interface, they have a number of behavioral quirks that make it difficult for users to get used to them:


- They require users to know that you select more than one entry by holding down the Ctrl key
- They lose all selections if you click in the wrong place.
- You can't tell if a Listbox is single-select or multi-select at first glance.

**Checked Listboxes**  are the ideal alternative. They're much more pleasant to use and are a good deal more intuitive - compare to the list above. Checked Listboxes tell users immediately that they have the ability choose multiple options.

- In ASP.NET, use <br>       **System.Web.UI.WebControls.CheckBoxList** . If you're having problems with there being too many items in the list, use a <br>       **scrolling DIV**
- In Windows Forms, use <br>       **System.Windows.Forms.CheckedListBox**
