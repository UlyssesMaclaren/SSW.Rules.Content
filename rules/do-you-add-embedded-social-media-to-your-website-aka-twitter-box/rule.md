People don't visit your Twitter profile as often as your website. It's a good idea to have your Twitter timeline on your website. Embeddable timelines are interactive and enable your visitors to reply, Retweet, and favorite Tweets directly from your website pages. ​ The best place to put it is on the sidebar.
 
Visit [https://dev.twitter.com/web/embedded-timelines​](https&#58;//dev.twitter.com/web/embedded-timelines) to view instructions on creating your embedded Twitter timeline.
