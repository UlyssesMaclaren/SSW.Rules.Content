**Standards should \*not\* be followed blindly. Aim for continual improvement.**

Of course there are pros and cons to having standards.

The pros:

- They help speed up the decision making process – getting you to the best decision faster
- They help [consistency](/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/DoYouUnderstandTheValueOfConsistency.aspx)


The cons:

- They take time to write in a generic fashion
- Technology ones rust easily. Technologies and techniques change often, so you must be on the lookout for the new and better approaches and need continual updating
- They have errors as they are written by imperfect people.
- People will sometimes follow an inappropriate rule. A set of rules can never predict every path, so  cases can and will appear that the standards fail to cater for.


**So standards should always help the critical thinking process, never replace it**

If you think something can be done better or the standard is simply out of date, improve the standard. Email the person responsible for the standard the specific changes you want made [(e.g. change "x" to "y](/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/Change-from-X-to-Y.aspx)").
