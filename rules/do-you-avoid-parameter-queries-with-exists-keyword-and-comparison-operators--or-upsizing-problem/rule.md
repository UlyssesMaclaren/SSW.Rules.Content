 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 

```
PARAMETERS [@Employee Last Name] Text ( 20 );    
SELECT Orders.OrderID
, Orders.CustomerID
, Orders.EmployeeID
FROM Orders
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT EmployeeID
 FROM Employees 
 WHERE LastName= [@Employee Last Name] 
 AND Employees.EmployeeID=Orders.EmployeeID) <> FALSE
```

Figure: Bad example of Access query with EXISTS keyword and comparison operator

WHERE EXISTS (SELECT EmployeeID 
 FROM Employees
 WHERE LastName= [@Employee Last Name] 
 AND Employees.EmployeeID=Orders.EmployeeID)
```

Figure: Good example of Access query with EXISTS keyword and without comparison operatorIn order to get the good example syntax you must switch from Design View window to SQL View in query designer window and save query definition.
