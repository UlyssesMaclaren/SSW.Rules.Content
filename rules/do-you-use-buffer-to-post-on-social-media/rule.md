​ Buffer is a great tool for managing multiple social media accounts across a range of sites such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, twitter, app.net and google+. It allows you to choose which accounts to post to, can post to multiple social media accounts at once, and even lets you write and schedule your posts to be released over the course of a day or even up to a week, so you don't need to be at your computer while maintaining an online presence. It also offers URL shortening and provides analytics so you can track the success of your posts across multiple sites.
 
You can either visit the [Buffer web app](https&#58;//buffer.com/) in your browser  or install a tool that sits next to the address bar of your browser.

You can also use the "Customize for each network" button to modify the content for each platform before you post it

The content of your posts should be consistent across accounts. When making a post that exceeds the character limit of a site such as twitter, you should write a separate, shorter version of the post to send to that site only. You can also use the "Customize for each network" button on Buffer to modify the content to better suit the platform for each post. This means that you could write the content for a Tweet and then modify it to remove things like #Hashtags to post it to LinkedIn where they don't make sense.

**Hashtags: **Hashtags are used across social sites such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and google+ to identify a keyword or topic of interest and facilitate a search for similar posts on the topic.

Establish a short hashtag that can be easily associated with your brand, company, or campaign and ensure this hashtag is used consistently across social networks, along with any other keywords relevant to the content of your post.

Note: LinkedIn does not support hashtags. If you use them in a post, they will show up on LinkedIn pages as plain text.

![Tweet example.jpg](/PublishingImages/Tweet%20example.jpg)​​​Figure: Bad example - only Tweeting using Twitter alone and not using a scheduler to post across the different media platforms at once. This is time consuming!​![Buffer2.jpg](/PublishingImages/Buffer2.jpg)Figure: Good example - posting using Buffer to modify your content between platforms - much faster than posting individually to each platform every time
