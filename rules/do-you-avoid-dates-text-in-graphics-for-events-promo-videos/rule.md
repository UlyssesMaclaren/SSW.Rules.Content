To maximize reusability and minimize costs, itâ€™s best to avoid including dates as text in graphics for promotional videos.
 [[badExample]]
| ![dates shown as text in graphics (creates extra work to change every time)![events-dates-good.png](events-dates-good.png)](events-dates-bad.png)
If there is some particular value/purpose in including dates there may be exceptions to this rule.
