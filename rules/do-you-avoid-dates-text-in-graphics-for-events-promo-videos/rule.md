To maximize reusability and minimize costs, itâ€™s best to avoid including dates as text in graphics for promotional videos.
 
[[badExample]]
| ![ dates shown as text in graphics ](events-dates-bad.png)
(creates extra work to change every time)
[[goodExample]]
| ![no dates shown as text in graphics ](events-dates-good.png)
(can be re-used without editing)
If there is some particular value/purpose in including dates there may be exceptions to this rule.
