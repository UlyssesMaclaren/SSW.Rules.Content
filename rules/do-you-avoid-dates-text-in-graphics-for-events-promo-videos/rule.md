To maximize reusability and minimize costs, itâ€™s best to avoid including dates as text in graphics for promotional videos.

<!--endintro-->

[[badExample]]
| ![dates shown as text in graphics](events-dates-bad.png)(creates extra work to change every time)
[[goodExample]]
| ![no dates shown as text in graphics](events-dates-good.png)(can be re-used without editing) 
If there is some particular value/purpose in including dates there may be exceptions to this rule.
