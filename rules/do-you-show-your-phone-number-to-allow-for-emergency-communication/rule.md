Email is great. But in an emergency, you need to pick up the phone. Often the most effective methods of communication for a project is to talk directly to colleagues and clients on the phone.

**Remote offices tip:** Donâ€™t make being overseas a barrier. Of course, it is always best to provide a local number as that gives clients peace of mind and keep their costs down. Not many clients will call an international number and there are lots of options - [http://www.skype.com/en/features](http://www.skype.com/en/features/).

The next best alternative is to at least show your overseas phone number.
