 Don’t make being overseas a barrier. Often the most effective methods of communication for a project is to talk directly to clients on the phone. It is better to provide a local phone number to the clients to ensure peace of mind and keep their costs down. Not many clients will call an international number.

It is better to provide a local phone number to the clients, to encourage them to call.


 
​The standard procedure of dealing with SkypeIn calls​:

1. If your Skype is online, it will ring your computer. (just like normal)
2. If your Skype is offline, it will redirect the call to your mobile / local phone.
