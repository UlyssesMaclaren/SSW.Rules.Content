 When you are regularly creating new releases of a cool .NET application or simply producing new proposals in Microsoft Word, files will inevitably become outdated. Rather than hit the DELETE key put a 'zz' at the front of the filename. The old versions should not be deleted straight away - it is just an unnecessary risk!<br> ![Obsolete old files aggressively](/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/PublishingImages/ObseleteOldFilesAggressively.gif)Figure: 'ZZ' your files rather than deleting them! 
Note: Other systems are used that are less aggressive than our 'zz' rule.

- In .NET, the keyword <br>      [obselete](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/Obselete.htm) ![Leave site](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Images/LeaveSite.gif) is used to mark types and members of types that should no longer be used - these then turn up as a compiler warning.
- In HTML, the keyword <br>      [deprecated](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/Deprecated.htm) ![leave site](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Images/LeaveSite.gif) is used.


Both allow for some backward compatibility.
