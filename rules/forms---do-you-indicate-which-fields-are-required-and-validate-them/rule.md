Always indicate which fields are required. Users get frustrated when they experience a wasted trip to the server, just because they did not get an obvious indication of what was required first time around.

A designer will know the best way to indicate required field depending on the layout. However if you are in doubt and donâ€™t have a designer around, a red asterisk is definitely the best option.

#### More Information

You should combine these visual indicators with appropriate client and server side validators to make sure that your data conforms to business requirements. Adding a RequiredFieldValidator to the above textboxes gives you data validity check with minimal coding.

ID="emailReqValidator" />
Figure: Good Example - an ASP.NET validator in use, to indicate the fields required

| **Note:** For ASP.NET Dynamic Data although validation is done differently (under the covers it is using a field template + the ASP.NET validator).
