As well as sending details of bookings to the traveler's outlook calendar, we also use tripit.com to consolidate the details of bookings for flights, hotels, car rentals, etc. TripIt can make a single, easy-to-read online itinerary that can be viewed by anyone you choose to share the link with, making it easy to keep co-travelers, spouses, co-workers, etc. in the loop.

After joining tripit.com, forward a copy of each booking confirmation to plans@tripit.com to store the details of upcoming journeys. Multiple items can then be merged to form one master itinerary that covers the whole trip.
