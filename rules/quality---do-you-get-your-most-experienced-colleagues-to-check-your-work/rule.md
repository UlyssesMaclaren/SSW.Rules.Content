It never hurts to get the advice of your colleagues, and getting advice from someone                     who's been doing what you're doing for a while will always teach you something new                     and improve the quality of your work.
 
For development, as your application starts to develop into a usable entity, make                     sure you get your Chief Architect (or equivalent) to have a look at what you're                     doing and wâ€‹eigh in with their advice.

You can do this through either a [test please](/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/InternalTestPlease.aspx)on an individual piece of work, or a [code review](/SoftwareDevelopment/RulestobetterArchitectureandCodeReview/Pages/Default.aspx) for the entire project.
