It never hurts to get the advice of your co-workers, and getting advice from someone                     who's been doing what you're doing for a while will always teach you something new                     and improve the quality of your work.
 
For development, as your application starts to develop into a usable entitiy, make                     sure you get your Chief Architect (or equivalent) to have a look at what you're                     doing and weigh in with their advice.
