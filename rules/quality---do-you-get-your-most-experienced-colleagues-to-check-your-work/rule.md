<span class='intro'>  <p>​It never hurts to get the advice of your colleagues, and getting advice from someone
                    who's been doing what you're doing for a while will always teach you something new
                    and improve the quality of your work. <br></p> </span>

<p>
                    For development, as your application starts to develop into a usable entity, make
                    sure you get your Chief Architect (or equivalent) to have a look at what you're
                    doing and w​eigh in with their advice.
