<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​We believe it is not good that use invalid characters (most of are Symbol characters, like&#160;&quot;,;&quot;\/(&quot;, etc.) in object identifiers. Though it is legal, it is easily confused and probably cause an error during run script on these objects.​<br></p> </span>
