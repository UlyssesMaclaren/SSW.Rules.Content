​​When you add an image to a website or application, it is so useful to add a figure underneath it to describe your image. 
(This is the same as how Microsoft Word does it when you add a caption.)

It's the best way of ensuring you catch users' attention to the content of your page. When you're scanning a newspaper for interesting articles, you'll check out the pictures, read the accompanying description, and if it sounds interesting you'll go back and read the article.

Users read websites in a similar fashion. Catch their attention with an image, and then keep it with a useful description. Don't just describe what the image is; say what it's used for in the context of the document. Look at these bad and good captions.
![Good Caption](/PublishingImages/good-caption.jpg)Figure: Good Example - Some nice useful text describing the image
It is especially important that images serve a purpose, as opposed to images which are there solely for design.

A good example of this rule can be seen in the figures at [SSW Code Auditor User Guide](https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/UserGuide.aspx) page.

### Tip #1 - Bold your captions


[image]


 Figure: [Description…] (not bolded)
[image]


Figure: [Description…] (bolded is best)


### Tip #2 - Describe the actions 

Especially for screenshots, it is a good idea to have your figure describe the action the user would take:


[image]


 Figure: This is the screen
[image]


 Figure: On the screen, choose the execution method



### Tip #3 - Give bad and good examples 

It's recommended that you use "bad" and "good" examples to clearly explain the DOs and DON'Ts.
Bear in mind to always show the bad example first, then good example, like below:



To print your document:
1. Select File | Print. The Print dialog should now show.
2. Select the number of copies and click Print. The file should now print.
Figure: Bad Example - Using 'should' implies uncertainty
To print your document: 
1. Select File | Print. The Print dialog is shown.
2. Select the number of copies and click Print. The file will now print.
Good example - Using present or future tense implies confidence
