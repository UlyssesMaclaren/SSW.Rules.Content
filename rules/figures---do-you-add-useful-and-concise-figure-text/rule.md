When you add an image to a website or application, follow the Microsoft Word standard and use **"Figure: Description"** to describe your images.

It's the best way of ensuring you catch users' attention to the content of your page. When you're scanning a newspaper for interesting articles, you'll check out the pictures, read the accompanying description, and if it sounds interesting you'll go back and read the article.

Users read websites in a similar fashion. Catch their attention with an image, and then keep it with a useful description. Don't just describe what the image is; say what it's used for in the context of the document. Look at these bad and good captions.

It is especially important that images serve a purpose, as opposed to images which are there solely for design.
