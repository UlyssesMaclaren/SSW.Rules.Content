<span class='intro'> <p>
                When a prospective client gets a quote for a huge price it's like giving them a slap in the face.
                Break your proposals into a series of <a href="http&#58;//sharepoint.ssw.com.au/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterProjectManagement/Pages/InitialReleasePlanandBallpark.aspx">releases</a> and 
                clients can choose to proceed with a smaller financial committment (such as just getting the mockups 
                done) than if they were committing to the whole project. Often, small financial commitments will 
                lead to bigger ones.
                </p> </span>

<p>
                    This approach also allows you to side-step common delaying tactics of prospective clients by making it easier to 
                    get the project moving.
