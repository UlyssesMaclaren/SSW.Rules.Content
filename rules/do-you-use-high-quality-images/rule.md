 You should use the best quality (high resolution) images in your presentations. You should never simply stretch a small, low-resolution photo to make it fit your layout as this degrade the resolution even further and the image will appear very coarse and granular on the projection screen.<br> <dl>    <dt><img alt="" class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" src="/Standards/Communication/RulesToBetterPowerpointPresentations/PublishingImages/low_d.gif"> </dt>
