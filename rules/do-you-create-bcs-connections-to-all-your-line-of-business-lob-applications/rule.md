In SharePoint 2007, we have Business Data Catalog to connect SharePoint to other line of business applications.  
<br>When you connect your other systems to SharePoint you can then have one central place to see your data:

1. Microsoft CRM connected to SharePoint allows you to search for CRM contacts from SharePoint<br>
2. TFS connected to SharePoint lets you see the project documents and reports via SharePoint<br>
3. Your roster system connected to SharePoint allows you to see those calendars in SharePoint<br>

  In SharePoint 2010 â€“ the Business Data Catalog is upgraded to the new Business Data Connectivity Service (BCS).

1. It is a lot easier to plug-in<br>
2. Supports not just READ operations, but delete, update and create operations as well.<br>
