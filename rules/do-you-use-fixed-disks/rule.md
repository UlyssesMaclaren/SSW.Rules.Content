<span class='intro'> When SysAdmins first get going with Hyper-V, they often choose to use dynamically expanding VHDâ€™s. They often do this to increase VHD creation time and reduce hard disk usage.<br>
<br>The problem with dynamically expanding VHDs is that they reduce the performance of the Virtual Machine. It is much better to use a fixed VHD when the Virtual Machine is used in a production environment.
