 ​​Minification and AMD are techniques to improve javascript performance. They can both can be used with vanilla JavaScript and with Typescript 
### ​​​AMD and RequireJs

AMD is a client-side technology​​​ that allows you to break you Js code into small inter-dependent modules. The modules (and thier dependencies) required to render a particular page are determined at runtime and subsequently downloaded by Javascript. RequireJs is a popular AMD implementation.
Pro: Only the js modules you need are downloadedCon: Each module is downloaded in a separate http request
### ​Bundling and Minification


​This is a server side technique that combines and optimises client side files into single, optimised downloads.

ASP.Net contains excellent server-side bundling support as outlined here: ​[http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/performance/bundling-and-minification​](http&#58;//www.asp.net/mvc/overview/performance/bundling-and-minification)

ASP.Net vnext & VS 2015 also provides support for using task runners like Gulp or Grunt for bundling and minification.​
Pro: Fewer Http requests and smaller filesCon: All client side modules are included in a single download​
