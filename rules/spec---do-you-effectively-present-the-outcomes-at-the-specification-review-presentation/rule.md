 ​The findings of the Spec Review should be presented at a meeting with the key decision makers of the project for review and acceptance, generally in the form of a PowerPoint presentation. It is important that all the required people are in a room together to review the plan.  ![It's a lot easier to get a signature when you've got the right people in the room](/PublishingImages/ProjectManagement_DecisionMakers_Small.jpg)   Figure: It's a lot easier to get a signature when you've got the right people in the room 
If you've run the Spec Review successfully the client should not be surprised by anything you present. This means discussions should focus on issues such as what particular requirements could be added into the scope in the first phase, or what releases can be completed by what date, rather than spending the meeting helping the client regain consciousness after they blacked out from seeing the price.

The Spec Review presentation should be scheduled by the Project Manager or Account Manager for the afternoon of the final day of the Spec Review. 

“I will send you a proposal when I get back to the office.” 
Figure: Bad example – a common mistake is to tell the client you will complete it later <br>      

“Let’s schedule a meeting now for Wed 2pm. I will send a meeting invite to all the stakeholders.” 
Figure: Good example – this is an appointment with specific time for the next schedule
 The benefits are:  
- You are striking while the iron is hot
- All parties benefit while the information is fresh in their minds
- The client wont experience the inevitable delays when you go back to the office and get stuck on other client issues that appear more urgent

 What does the client get at the conclusion of the Spec Review?  

- An email, or
- A Word document, or
- A PowerPoint presentation
- A PowerPoint presentation with narrations, exported to a video (recommended)

Once again, the presentation needs to pass a '[test please](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=d66a9404-2ca9-4d19-ad6c-df1618b4fc28 "Test Please")' from another senior employee before the meeting takes place.
