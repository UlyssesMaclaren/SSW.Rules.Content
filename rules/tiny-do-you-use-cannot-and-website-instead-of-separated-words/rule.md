Grammatically, all of them are acceptable spellings, but in these specific cases, one word is more usual. Refer to [AskOxford](http&#58;//www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cannot)for reference.

Note: When there are two ways of doing something, we make a rule on it one way with the goal of having complete consistency.
 
You can not change the world.

Figure: Bad example – two separated words
You cannot change the world.


Figure: Good example - using these terms in one word


We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/) to check for this rule.
