 Sometimes it can be unclear to The Scrum Team whether a Story can be completed as required. <br>   For example the story “automatically package with Wise after the automatic build” requires investigation to see if this is possible.  It is then best to write a new story “Spike - Investigate whether it is possible to automatically build with Wise”.  This story can be more accurately estimated and the result will allow the original story to be estimated or revised. We call that investigation a Spike.

 All Spikes are experiments or investigations of just enough detail to determine an estimate for the related story.  All Spikes must be timeboxed as otherwise the process of investigation can meander and never come to a conclusion. 

 To embark on the original story when it was inestimable would be irresponsible and leave The Team with a potentially impossible story and the risk of a failed sprint.
