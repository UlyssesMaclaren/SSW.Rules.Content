 Sometimes it can be unclear to The Scrum Team whether a Story can be completed as required.  For example the story "automatically package with Wise after the automatic build" requires investigation and experimentation to see if this is possible and to provide a meaningful estimate for the original.<br> 
How is experimentation done? In agile software development, when you have an unknown, you do a spike story.  A spike is a time boxed investigation with the output being the answer to an experiment or investigation and the resolution of an estimate for the original story.

It is then best to write a new story “Investigate whether it is possible to automatically build with Wise”.  This story can be more accurately estimated and the result will allow the original story to be estimated or revised.

**Figure: Bad example – I want you to implement something, but I am not going to tell you what it is. How long will it take?**

To embark on the original story when it is inestimable would be irresponsible and leave The Team with a potentially impossible story and the risk of a failed sprint.

All investigating stories must be timeboxed otherwise the process of investigation can meander and never come to a conclusion.

**Figure: Good example – The spike (time boxed investigation) comes first as it is impossible to estimate implementing something you do not know**

Note: This gives you work for future Sprint

Tip: There is a further benefit of tagging 'spike' tasks with a consistent label. If your company takes up R & D tax incentives, then you need to be able to query for activities that were 'of an experimental nature'. In Australia this is a 15% credit on each dollar you spend on a developer.
