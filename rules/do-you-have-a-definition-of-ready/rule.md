As part of the update to the Scrum Guide for 2013, there is a concept of a product backlog being "Ready".
 
Just like how the team has a     [Definition of Done](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=6449ae79-ba88-447e-aa48-36173029a2af) as a checklist for completing a PBI, the product owner needs a Definition of Ready to get the PBI in a state that’s ready for it to be added to a sprint. This should be done as part of the refinement (aka grooming) process and will greatly streamline the sprint planning meeting.

A recommended “Definition of Ready” would be:

- Has enough detail for the team to action (usually via good Acceptance Criteria)
- Has <br>      [Business Value](/Pages/Estimate-Business-Value.aspx) assigned
- Has effort assigned
- Is in the Approved state


**Related Rule:**

- <br>      [Done - Do you go beyond 'Done' and follow a 'Definition of Done'?](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=6449ae79-ba88-447e-aa48-36173029a2af)
