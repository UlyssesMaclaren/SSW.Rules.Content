It's amazing how often you can't simply do a **"****Get Latest"** and compile.

​A good developer makes it clear how to get a new project and compile it.

Check they have instruction files in their solution as per [Instructions Help Web Projects](/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterDotNETProjects/Pages/InstructionsHelpImproveWebProjects.aspx).

Warning: If this step is problematic, there are other things you could start teaching a developer about to improve their process.  For example, are they using [Test Driven Development](/TFS/RulesToBetterVersionControlwithTFS%28AKASourceControl%29/Pages/TestDrivenProcess.aspx), or are they checking in regularly, but this should be saved for the [Team & Process Review](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/SoftwareAudit.aspx).
