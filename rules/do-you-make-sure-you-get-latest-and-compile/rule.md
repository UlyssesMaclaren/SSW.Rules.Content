It's amazing how often you can't simply do a Get Latest and compile.

 

Having an instruction file in your solution helps people take over the project easily: [http://rules.ssw.com.au/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterDotNETProjects/Pages/InstructionsHelpImproveWebProjects.aspx](/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterDotNETProjects/Pages/InstructionsHelpImproveWebProjects.aspx)​
 
​A good developer makes it clear how to get a new project and compile it.

Warning: There are other things you could start teaching a developer about to improve their process.  For example, are they using Test Driven Development, or are they checking in regularly, but this should be saved for the Team Process review.
