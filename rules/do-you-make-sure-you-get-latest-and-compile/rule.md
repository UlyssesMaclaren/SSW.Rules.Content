<span class='intro'> <p>It's amazing how often you can't simply do a <strong>&quot;</strong><strong>Get Latest&quot;</strong> and compile.</p>
<p>â€‹A good developer makes it clear how to get a new project and compile it.</p>
<p>Check they have instruction files in their solution as per the <a href="/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterDotNETProjects/Pages/DoYouMakeInstructions.aspx">Do you make instructions at the beginning of a project and improve them gradually?</a> rule.</p> </span>

<p><strong>Warning&#58;</strong> If this step is problematic, there are other things you could start teaching&#160;the developers about to improve their process.&#160; For example, are they using <a href="/TFS/RulesToBetterVersionControlwithTFS(AKASourceControl)/Pages/TestDrivenProcess.aspx">Test Driven Development</a>, or are they checking in regularly, but this should be saved for the <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/SoftwareAudit.aspx">Team&#160;&amp;&#160;Process Review</a>.&#160;</p>
