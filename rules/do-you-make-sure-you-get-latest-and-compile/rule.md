It's amazing how often you can't simply Clone a repository (aka "Get Latest") and compile it.

A good developer makes it clear how to get a new project, compile it and have a smooth "F5" experience.

Check they have a README or instruction files in their solution as per the [Do you make instructions at the beginning of a project and improve them gradually?](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=d6d34c31-ac6a-49a4-876a-f9d30e1ab78a) rule.
