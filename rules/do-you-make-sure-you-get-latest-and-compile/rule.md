It's amazing how often you can't simply do a **"****Get Latest"** and compile.

â€‹A good developer makes it clear how to get a new project and compile it.

Check they have instruction files in their solution as per the [Do you make instructions at the beginning of a project and improve them gradually?](/do-you-make-instructions-at-the-beginning-of-a-project-and-improve-them-gradually) rule.
