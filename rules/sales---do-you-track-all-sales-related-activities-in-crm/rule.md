Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 allows users to track activities such as emails, appointments,           phone calls, etc. This feature can be easily abused by users to record unrelated           activities inside CRM. It is difficult sometimes to work out which type of activities           should be recorded. These are the types of activities you should track in CRM:
 
- Appointments: Initial meeting, and follow-up meetings...
- Phone Calls: Any incoming and outgoing sales related phone call (note CRM 2013 has Lync and Skype integration to automatically track outgoing phone calls)​
- Emails: Sales related emails


All sales activities should be set regarding to an opportunity, company or contact.

Hi Robert,
 As per our conversation, Dan will be starting on Monday 1st March.

We discussed using a second resource on the project with Dan. You and Dan will assess whether this is necessary during the first week and make a decision.

I will call you in a week or so to see how things are progressing.

By recording these activities, reports can be created to view:

- The guys doing the most sales activities.
 e.g. The "Activities" report. This should be printed monthly and posted on the wall.
- Which opportunities have been neglected. This is a custom report​
- The history fo​r all sales activities relating to an opportunity. This is useful to review before making a call.
