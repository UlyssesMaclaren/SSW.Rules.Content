Often times incorrect process is the source of problems.
 
Developers should be able to focus on what is important for the project rather than getting stuck on things they shouldn't have to worry about.

1. Are devs getting bogged down in the UI? [TODO - Damian: create page and link]
2. Do you have continuous integration and deployment?
3. [Do you have a Schema Master?](/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterSQLServerSchemaDeployment/Pages/DoYouHaveASchemaMaster.aspx)
4. Do you have a TFS Master?
5. Do you have a Scrum Master?
