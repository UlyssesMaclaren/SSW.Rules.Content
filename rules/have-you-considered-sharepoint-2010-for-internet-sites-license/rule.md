Microsoft recognised this problem, and in SharePoint 2010 line up, they added an additional &quot;SharePoint 2010 for Internet Sites&quot; licenses for standard and enterpise features.&#160;<br>

Microsoft has yet to release pricings for SharePoint 2010 - but we can expect the internet sites for standard SharePoint Server to be highly comparable.
