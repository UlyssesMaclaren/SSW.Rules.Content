 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field).   Microsoft recognised this problem, and in SharePoint 2010 line up, they added an additional "SharePoint 2010 for Internet Sites" licenses for standard and enterpise features.Â 

 Microsoft has yet to release pricings for SharePoint 2010 - but we can expect the internet sites for standard SharePoint Server to be highly comparable.
