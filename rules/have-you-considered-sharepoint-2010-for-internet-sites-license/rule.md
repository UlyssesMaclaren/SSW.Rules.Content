<span class='intro'> In MOSS 2007, to run a public&#160;internet site on SharePoint included many hidden costs that soon accumulate to a big number that puts it out of the reach of most small and medium companies.<br>
<br>
As a rough calculation -&#160;it costs over $160k to run 3 MOSS servers with internet license for internet sites.&#160; As much as people loved the features of MOSS for publishing sites - this was a major drawback.
 </span>

Microsoft recognised this problem, and in SharePoint 2010 line up, they added an additional &quot;SharePoint 2010 for Internet Sites&quot; licenses for standard and enterpise features.&#160;<br>
<br>
Microsoft has yet to release pricings for SharePoint 2010 - but we can expect the internet sites for standard SharePoint Server to be highly comparable.
