​TypeScript is the new flagship language from Microsoft that compiles into JavasScript.

- Use JavaScript if you’re writing page specific script
- Use jQuery to improve cross-browser support
- Use TypeScript if you’re writing re-usable client side library


Don't use CoffeeScript (language is too different from JavaSript)
 
![ Good - TypeScript is very similar to JavaScript so it’s easy to learn, and also helps developers learn proper JavaScript coding practices​    ](typescript-good.jpg)

![ Bad – CoffeeScript syntax is very different from JavaScript so it takes longer to learn ​](typescript-bad.jpg)
