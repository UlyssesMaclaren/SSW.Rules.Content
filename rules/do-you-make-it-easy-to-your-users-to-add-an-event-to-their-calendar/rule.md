If you have a date for any event appearing on your site, you should make it as easy                     as possible for the user to add it to their Outlook calendar. This is why we use                     ICS links for all dates on our site

 <br>   Figure: Good Example - Showing use of Calendar icon
By clicking the calendar icon you can easily add reminder to remind you about particular event out of your busy schedule.

You have 2 options - VCS and ICS. Both let you add appointments to your calendar. We use ICS because it allows     collaborating information between personal information management programs like Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Calendar, Mac     OS etc. over the Internet, independently of differences between program vendors or operating systems, which is not allowed with VCS.

It is always preferred to use     [standard icons](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterWebsitesNavigation.aspx#TheIcons) to give user a proper idea about the file. User can quickly get the idea by just looking at the icon.
