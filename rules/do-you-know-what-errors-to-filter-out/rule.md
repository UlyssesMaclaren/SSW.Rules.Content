You should always keep on top of your RayGun crashreporting and not let the errors spiral out of control. If use RayGun with a web application, then youâ€™ll frequently get a lot of errors with robots scanning the site and creating 404s.  
  
[[badExample]]

Luckily RayGun has built-in filtering to hide these frequent exceptions.
 
![](raygun-filter.png) 
To enable filtering:

1. Under  **Crash Reporting**  > select  **Filtering**
2. SSW recommends you turn on the following rules
    1. Discard any requesters where the user-agent is a known crawler bot
    2. Discard any request for non-existent resources (404)
    3. Discard any requests related to phpMyAdmin access attempts


Now you should have a nice clean crash report page with actual errors.
