 Don't waste time evaluating which middle tier .Net libraries to use. Most of the commonly used libraries are very similar in fuctionality. By sticking to a library, you can also increase your expertise in it, reducing development time in the future. 
​At SSW, we use:

- [StructureMap](/Pages/Do-You-Know-the-Best-Dependency-Injection-Container.aspx) for IoC
- [Log4Net](/do-you-use-the-best-trace-logging-library), or [Telerik EQATE​C](http&#58;//www.telerik.com/analytics) for Tracing
- [Application Insights for Visual Studio Online](/rules-to-better-application-insights-for-visual-studio-online), [Telerik EQATEK​](http&#58;//www.telerik.com/analytics), or [ELMAH](/do-you-use-the-best-exception-handling-library) for Error Handling
