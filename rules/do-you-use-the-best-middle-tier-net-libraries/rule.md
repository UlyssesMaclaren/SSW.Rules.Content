 Don't waste time evaluating which middle tier .Net libraries to use. Most of the commonly used libraries are very similar in fuctionality. By sticking to a library, you can also increase your expertise in it, reducing development time in the future. 
â€‹At SSW, we use:

- StructureMap for IoC
- TFS Application Analytics, Log4Net, or Telerik Eqatek for Tracing
- TFS Application Analytics, Telerik Eqatek, or ELMAH for Error Handling
