Managers (or clients), like all of us, are snowed under with work and won't always remember appointments with you. But keeping a good line of communication open is essential and it's up to you to make it happen. No matter that your weekly meeting gets cancelled, or your boss appears to avoid you for the week, stop and talk to them in the corridor, or pick up the phone and give them an update.

If you know you've got issues to discuss (such as looming deadlines), don't wait for the client or your manager to bring it up, take a pro-active approach and schedule a meeting.

As a guideline you should not go more than 2 weeks without talking to your boss. And don't forget all the things you've got to say - have a sub-folder in your Inbox such as "Ask the Boss". Next time when the boss asks "does anyone want to speak to me?", look in that folder.
What do you mean?

<br>                    UlyFigure: OK example - calling, then bouncing emails back(I called you and left a message as I need clarification - so have moved it to 'Ask the boss')
