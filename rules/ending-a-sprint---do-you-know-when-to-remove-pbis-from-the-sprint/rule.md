 There are two reasons that a story can be removed from the sprint. <br> 
1. Your team notices that they can’t get everything done, and agree with the product owner to remove the story.
2. At the Sprint Review meeting the Product Owner rejects the story


In both these cases the Story moves back to the backlog and any unfinished tasks left in the sprint are closed. The PO may decide to prioritise the story high enough to make the next Sprint, but he may not.
