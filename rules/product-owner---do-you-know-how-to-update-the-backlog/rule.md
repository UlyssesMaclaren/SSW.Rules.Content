The Product Owner is responsible for updating and managing the Product backlog.

There are three options:

1. **Team Web Access **- E.g. https://tfs.ssw.com.a​u/tfs  ![image](/SiteAssets/product-owner-do-you-know-how-to-update-the-backlog/RulesScrumUpdateBacklogGood.jpg "image") Figure: TFS Web Access is the best way
2. **Emails** - This is a very poor way to access and update the backlog as you can’t order the emails by business priority
3. **Team Companion** ![](/PublishingImages/RulesScrumUpdateBacklogBest.jpg) Figure: Team Companion lets you edit work items right in Outlook


Decide whatever works best for you; SSW recommends using the backlog directly via web access
