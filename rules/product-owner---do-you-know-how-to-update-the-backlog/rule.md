Your Product Owner is responsible for updating and managing the Product backlog.

Do they know how?

1. **Team Web Access**

**Figure:Team Web Access is the best way
**
2. **Emails**
<br>    This is a very poor way to access and update the backlog as you canâ€™t order the emails by business priority.
3. **Team Companion**

Decide whatever works best for you; SSW recommends Team Companion
