The Product Owner is responsible for updating and managing the Product backlog.

There are three options:

1. **Team Web Access**

**Figure: TFS Web Access is the best way
**
2. **Emails**
<br>    This is a very poor way to access and update the backlog as you can’t order the em​ails by business priority.
3. **Team Companion**

Decide whatever works best for you; SSW recommends using the backlog directly via web access
