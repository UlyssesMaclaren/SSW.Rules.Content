**Note**: 
1) Moving a rule page physically is not needed anymore, because all rule pages are staying in the same "Pages" library after we moved rule pages from 100+ subwebs into one "Pages" library in root web.

2) If you want a rule page to be shown on a different rule summary page, just simply change the "Rule Category" filed value to the relevant "rule category" name.

Sometimes you might need to move a rule from a category to another. You can do this by following these steps:

(Steps 1 and 2 can be skipped by clicking on [this link](/_layouts/15/sitemanager.aspx?Source=%7bWebUrl%7d_layouts/15/settings.aspx) )

2. Under "Site Administration", click on "Content and structure": <br>      ![content-structure.png](/Communication/Rules-to-Better-Adding-Rules/PublishingImages/Pages/how-to-move-a-rule/content-structure.png)Figure: Go to "Content and structure"
