The way you present information to prospective clients determines its effectiveness.        In a cluttered environment we skilfully organize information for the greatest impact.        When advertising software we like to use the following standard.
 
â€‹

1. **First Sentence (aka Tag Line)**
<br>        This is a one line sentence that explains the benefits of using the software. This<br>        description is non-technical, but should give an idea of who the software is for.<br>        E.g. "Automate your code reviews with SSW Code Auditor"
2. **First Paragraph**
<br>        A paragraph that describes in greater the detail what the software does, what Microsoft<br>        products it works with (e.g. Access, Outlook, SQL Server etc) and any initial technical<br>        notes. E.g. "SSW SQL Total Compare resolves data conflicts with SQL Server Replication.<br>        This tool reports the differences between the Publisher and Subscribers the data."
3. **Key Features & Benefits**
<br>        It's now time to convince the web surfer that they want the product. This section<br>        needs to summarize in bullet points why this product is going to solve their problems.<br>        If necessary group the benefits into logical categories.
4. **Screen Shots**
<br>        One screen shot on the first page is important for customers to <br>get the look and feel of the application. Then link to more screenshots.
5. **A Recorded Demonstration**
<br>        Customers love demonstrations especially when they are faced with using a product<br>        that they have never used before. An .avi is a great and innovative way to coach<br>        people on how to use products, and work with regardless of where they are around the<br>        world.
6. **Testimonials**
<br>        Place a testimonial from another user who's already using the software. Customer's tesimonial tends<br>        to be informal and the message can be easily understood by your visitors.
7. **User Guide**
<br>        This is help facility is designed to quickly get you up and running. Once again<br>        if you can offer it to customers make sure you let them know about it
8. **How it works**
<br>        This is a brief technical description of what goes on behind the scenes
9. **System Requirements**
<br>        The minimum system specifications to run the application.
10. **Support**
<br>        One of the most important attributes that customers of software products look for<br>        when they make a purchase is whether or not there will be support if they are stuck<br>        and having difficulties with the software. One very cost effective method of support<br>        is to provide a [knowledge base](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/KB/KBSearch.aspx) where customers are free to seek the answers to their<br>        own problems.
