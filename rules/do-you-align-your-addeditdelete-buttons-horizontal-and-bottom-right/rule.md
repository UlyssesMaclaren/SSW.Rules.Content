Usually there are problems fitting buttons next to datagrids or  listboxes when trying to imply that those buttons add functionality to  the datagrid or listbox.

| ![This form places the Add and Delete buttons in the top right.](../../assets/BadButtonAlign.jpg)
![Buttons aligned vertically, however they cut off useful information in the datagrid](../../assets/BetterButtonAlign.jpg)(Better)
[[goodExample]]
| ![Buttons align horizontally at the bottom right of the grid which provides plenty of room for then needed information](../../assets/GoodButtonAlign.jpg)
