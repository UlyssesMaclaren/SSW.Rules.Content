The first meeting is on us. While we have 1 - 2 hours to provide the prospective                     client with enough information to decide whether to pursue a [Spec Review](/Management/RulestoBetterSpecificationReviews/Pages/Default.aspx), the focus                     of the initial meeting is the client, their problem, and how we might build                     a solution.

The best way to action this is to ask questions, listen and take notes:                     Clients appreciate someone genuinely considering their needs. A brainstorming session                     is a fantastic way to give and receive feedback immediately. Even if the client                     decides not to use us, we like to leave them with useful information and a positive                     impression.
 
The purpose of the initial meeting is to:

- Listen - Understand the client's motivation for engaging software consultants. We all know<br>                        clients 'want a software application built', but understanding the motivation<br>                        for getting that software built will assist you in making a successful bid for the<br>                        project. Three examples could be: 
1. To replace an outdated, hard to maintain existing<br>                        system that's core to the business.
2. Building new 'nice-to-have' functionality to allow<br>                        the client to offer a new service to the market. 
3. Assisting a start-up company<br>                        with a speculative venture.
- Listen - Understand the 'pain level' of the client
- Listen - Determine whether scope, time, quality or cost has the highest priority for the<br>                        client and what level of project management they require. E.g. if a project must<br>                        be delivered by June 30, a high level of management will be required to ensure enough<br>                        resources are supplied to achieve this
- Listen - Understand as much as you can about the processes/business rules the system has<br>                        to manage. Every level of detail you can correctly comprehend and confirm back builds<br>                        your credibility as a good communicator and supplier!
- Listen - Assess the overall scope of the project, i.e. is this is 'small', 'medium' or 'large'<br>                        project. The attending Architect should start guessing how many man months this project<br>                        might be. This information will help you assess how long the spec review should be.<br>                        These initial thoughts should not be shared with the client at this stage as they<br>                        are most likely incorrect.
- Listen - Determine the client's budget and who controls that budget. E.g. Are you dealing<br>                        with the business owner or a line manager in a corporation? Do they have a fixed<br>                        amount to spend? Do they have a time period to spend it in?
- Listen - Find out if this is the sort of project you can do and want to do
- Listen - Qualify the client to make sure they can afford what they want
- Consider technology options
- Introduce your team, explain how our involvement<br>                        can​ help them, and whether we have a 'good fit'
- Explain your rates, including pre-paid
- Explain the strengths and challenges of a Time and Materials or Fixed Price approach
- Explain our development method including the importance of a Specification Review
- Take exceptional notes
- Ask for the sale: "This project is right up our alley and we'd love to be involved,<br>                        is there anything stopping us from scheduling a [Specification Review](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/rules/RulestoSuccessfulSalesAccountManagement.aspx#first-date)?" This will focus the mind of the client on the next step​
