 How many times has another staff member given you a phone number to call back which was wrong? This should never happen. I know this sounds like a bit of a no-brainer but as a simple rule, we say that you should always get the prospect's full contact details. These details should then be added to your company database (just in case that post-it note they wrote it on disappears). Here are some of the important details that need to be recorded: 
 
- Full name
- Company
- Position
- Phone number (work and mobile)
- Email address
- Company address
- How many employees does your company have? (This determines whether we go there or they come here.)â€‹
