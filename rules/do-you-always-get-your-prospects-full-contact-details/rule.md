<span class='intro'> How many times has another staff member given you a phone number to call back which was wrong? This should never happen. I know this sounds like a bit of a no-brainer but as a simple rule, we say that you should always get the prospect's full contact details. These details should then be added to your company database (just in case that post-it note they wrote it on disappears). Here are some of the important details that need to be recorded&#58; <br> </span>

<ul><li>Full name<br></li><li>Company</li><li>Position</li><li>Phone number (work and mobile)</li><li>Email address</li><li>Company address<br></li><li>How many employees does your company have? (This determines whether we go there or they come here.)â€‹<br></li></ul>
