 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 
**Time and Materials**

Time and materials is the standard mode of operation where the client is billed for the time spent by the consultant. There is no warranty on time and materials work.

**Fixed Price**

Fixed price is where the client is billed a fixed amount agreed between the client and the consultant. Fixed price contracts have the following conditions:

- All specification work to be conducted on a Time and Materials basis
- All screen mock-ups and business rules must be signed by the client
- A fixed price can only be done on a release by release basis, not on an entire project (this protects everyone)
- A 20% premium is added to the release estimates - just like an insurance premium because the consultant is carrying the risk
- Variations/change requests through the development and testing of the release are moved to the next release (otherwise dependencies are too affected)
- Development is conducted off-site (to prevent unauthorised scope-development)
- 50% of the fixed price is payable before work commences, the balance is payable at the delivery of the first external test please
- There is a 30 day warranty on [bugs](/Standards/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/BugDefinition.aspx) which commences when the first external test please is issued
- The following release cannot commence until the prior release is signed-off.
