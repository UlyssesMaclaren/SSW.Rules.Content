 Communication is a critical part in project management and it's essential to provide as much information as possible to your clients so they know the project's progress.

<br>We provide the following two reports to clients: <br> 
- Project Progress Report: This report helps clients to review the current project progress, check the status of the project and whether they are over or under estimates.

- Project Update from eXtreme Emails helps client to understand what's involved in the project.
