<span class='intro'>  <p>​
                    Many developers sit with their faces to the screen, isolating themselves from
                    the team, trying to solve a problem on their own. If you're stuck on one bug for
                    more than an hour, ask someone to help.
                <br></p> </span>

<p>No-one gets a medal for solving a problem
                    on their own in 2 days, when it could've been solved by 2 people in a couple of
                    hours.</p><p>​The <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=731a3f5d-a266-4944-876c-a45afa82832f">Daily Scrum</a>​​ is a good time to bring up any ongoing issues or sticking points if you haven't already.<br></p>
