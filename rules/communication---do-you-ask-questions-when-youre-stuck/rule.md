Many developers sit with their faces to the screen, isolating themselves from                     the team, trying to solve a problem on their own. If you're stuck on one bug for                     more than an hour, ask someone to help.
 
No-one gets a medal for solving a problem                     on their own in 2 days, when it could've been solved by 2 people in a couple of                     hours.
