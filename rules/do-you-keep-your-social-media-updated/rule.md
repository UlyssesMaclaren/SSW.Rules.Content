Use Buffer (see Rule “[Do you use Buffer to post to social media?​](/Pages/Do-you-use-Buffer-to-post-to-social-media.aspx)”) to post to your social media sites at least 3 times a week (ideally daily) with upcoming events, information about products or services, relevant news items or images, or anything else that you think your followers would be interested in. These posts maintain your online presence and are great advertising.
