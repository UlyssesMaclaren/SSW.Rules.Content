​​As we know, [a​n image is worth a thousand words​](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=05d3e94e-36d1-40e7-ba91-42dc1ada45ad)​. So here are some examples of how to make cleaner forms:
 
###  Bad Example

A fairly standard Access 97 application that needs some love (Before a makeover)
![Before a makeover](accessui_candidateedit1_before.gif)Figure: Avoid using background colors for your form controls - they can be confusing![Before a makeover](accessui_candidateedit2_before.gif)Figure: Avoid using non-standard fonts on your forms - keep them as close to Windows XP forms as possible![Before a makeover](accessui_candidateedit3_before.gif)Figure: All these forms will be grouped into a tabbed form![Before a makeover](accessui_candidateedit4_before.gif)![Before a makeover](accessui_candidatesearch_before.gif)Figure: The colors on this form are very distracting and add no value to the user - keep it clean
###  Good Example 

Screenshots of the existing Application in Access 97 after an SSW makeover (Good)​​
![After a makeover](accessui_candidateedit1_after.gif)Figure: This is the same application above - can you believe it? We grouped the forms into tabs![After a makeover](accessui_candidateedit2_after.gif)Figure: The icons give the form visual appeal and help to break up the plain colors![After a makeover](accessui_candidateedit3_after.gif)Figure: It's easy to present your form more cleanly and with a Windows XP feel![After a makeover](accessui_candidatesearch_after.gif)Figure: Even tricky forms with lots of logic can be tidied up. We used XP-styled controls and careful alignment to make this form more usable
###  Better Example

Access 2007 is an Easy Way to Give Your Old Access Application a new look (Best)​

These samples are from a Property Purchase and Negotiation Tracking application created for Queensland Water Infrastructure.​

It looks even better than the revamped Access 97 application![Aqua_Valuation.jpg](Aqua_Valuation.jpg)Figure: Note the Action buttons in the top right hand corner - they are based on the Access 2007 templates![Aqua_PickerForm.jpg](Aqua_PickerForm.jpg)Figure: This picker form is based on a web-style picker UI such as Hotmail so users have a familiar UI![Aqua_Agreement.jpg](Aqua_Agreement.jpg)Figure: With the use of frames with background colours, we have visually grouped controls
