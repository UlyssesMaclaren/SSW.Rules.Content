As we know, [an image is worth a thousand words](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=05d3e94e-36d1-40e7-ba91-42dc1ada45ad). So here are some examples of how to make cleaner forms:
 
###  Bad Example

A fairly standard Access 97 application that needs some love (Before a makeover)

![Avoid using background colors for your form controls - they can be confusing](accessui_candidateedit1_before.gif)
![Avoid using non-standard fonts on your forms - keep them as close to Windows XP forms as possible](accessui_candidateedit2_before.gif)
![All these forms will be grouped into a tabbed form](accessui_candidateedit3_before.gif)
![](accessui_candidateedit4_before.gif)
![The colors on this form are very distracting and add no value to the user - keep it clean](accessui_candidatesearch_before.gif)
###  Good Example 

Screenshots of the existing Application in Access 97 after an SSW makeover (Good)

![This is the same application above - can you believe it? We grouped the forms into tabs](accessui_candidateedit1_after.gif)
![The icons give the form visual appeal and help to break up the plain colors](accessui_candidateedit2_after.gif)
![It's easy to present your form more cleanly and with a Windows XP feel](accessui_candidateedit3_after.gif)
![Even tricky forms with lots of logic can be tidied up. We used XP-styled controls and careful alignment to make this form more usable](accessui_candidatesearch_after.gif)
###  Better Example

Access 2007 is an Easy Way to Give Your Old Access Application a new look (Best)

These samples are from a Property Purchase and Negotiation Tracking application created for Queensland Water Infrastructure.
