 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 
Using either [Google Desktop Search](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/GoogleSearch.htm) ![Leave Site](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Images/LeaveSite.gif) or [MSN Desktop Search](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/MSNSearch.htm) ![Leave Site](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Images/LeaveSite.gif) will allow you to instantly search for a name and find all correspondence with that person. Even if there has been no contact for 6 months, you can resume the discussion as if it were yesterday.

Of course if you are using Windows Vista, desktop search is integrated within the operating system.

Follow our standard on [setting up Enterprise Search](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/DeveloperInstallationNetworkSetup/DesktopSearch.aspx).
