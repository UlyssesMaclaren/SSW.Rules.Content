 Enter Intro Text 
â€‹The buttons that a user will typically use to close a form should be named consistently across your applications.

- **Save** button could possibly update the fields but keep the form open.
- **Close** could save the fields, then close the form, when the ** Cancel** button may be more appropriate.


We recommend the age-old standards of:

- **OK**. Close the form and save any changed data. This should be referenced by the form's AcceptButton property.
- **Cancel**. Close the form without saving. This should be referenced by the form's CancelButton property.
- **Apply**. Save data without closing the form.

We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/) to check for this rule.
