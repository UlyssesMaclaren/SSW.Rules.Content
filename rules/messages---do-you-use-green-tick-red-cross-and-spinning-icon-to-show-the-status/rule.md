It is very important to use a clear information icon to show the current status. The icon should be consistent with the actual status.
 ![ Bad Example - The icon is not consistent with the actual status![spinning icon to show status](../assets/spinningIconStatus.gif)](../assets/wrongIconStatus.gif)
We have another similar rule for Web application - [Do you use icons in web pages to indicate status directly?](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/rules/RulesToBetterWebsitesLayout.aspx#StatusIcon)

You can get [SSW's ticks and crosses here.](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/images/OurTicksCrosses/browse.aspx)
