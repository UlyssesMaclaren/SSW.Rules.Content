<span class='intro'> 
  <p>The logo and tagline are typically used in marketing and advertising. The general concept is to create a catchphrase that will sum up the tone of a brand and to reinforce the audience's memory of a product.</p>
<p>
Neither of these elements are intended to distract, so they are placed in the footer of the slide. It is present, but the influence is subtle and your audienceâ€™s focus will remain squarely on the content.
