 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 

Hi Ed,

 As per our conversation today, here is a ballpark schedule for the work we talked about. As you can see all the items are listed separately so you can identify how the estimate is put together. I'm very happy to discuss these estimates with you so feel free to give me a call.

Figure: Always call the client to let them know that you are about to send a quote across, then send an "[As per our conversation](/Standards/Management/RulesToHappyClients/Pages/DoYouAlwaysSendAnAsPerOurConversationEmail.aspx)" email.
