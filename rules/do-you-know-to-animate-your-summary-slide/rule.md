When you show all of your content on a slide when it first loads many people will read ahead of what you are saying.

The summary slide is very important. It's your chance to re-iterate what you have covered in the talk, and remind the audience of your key points.
 
You want them listening to you, not reading ahead.

Animating the items on your Summary slide ensures they are listening to you, not reading ahead.
