​How do you want customers to send you feedback? Phone calls? Emails? A website? 
There are a number of web applications that do a great job on this:
 
    - UserVoice
    - GetSatisfication​
    - UserEcho​

[UserVoice](https&#58;//www.uservoice.com/) is the most popular platform to collect, manage, and prioritize user feedback. It has a voting and tickets system out of box. <br>   
Many software houses use this for their products eg. SSW Code Auditor, SSW Link Auditor
