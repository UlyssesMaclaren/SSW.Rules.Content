​​​How do you want customers to send you feedback? Phone calls? Emails? A website? 
There are a number of web applications that do a great job on this:
 
- [UserVoice​](https&#58;//www.uservoice.com/)
- [GetSatisfication​](https&#58;//getsatisfaction.com/corp/)
- [UserEcho​​](https&#58;//userecho.com/)

 ![codeauditoruservoice.jpg](/PublishingImages/codeauditoruservoice.jpg) Figure: The UserVoice website allows user to enter suggestions (used here by SSW Code Auditor)![admin.jpg](/PublishingImages/admin.jpg) Figure: UserVoice has an Administrator console to track feedback 
[UserVoice](https&#58;//www.uservoice.com/) is the most popular platform to collect, manage, and prioritize user feedback. It has a voting and tickets system out of the box.

Many software houses use this for their products E​g. SSW Code Auditor, SSW Link Auditor


Here are the google results as at 2014
