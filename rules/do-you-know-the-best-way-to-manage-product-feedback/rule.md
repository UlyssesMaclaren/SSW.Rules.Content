How do you want customers to send you feedback? Phone calls? Emails? A website? 
There are a number of web applications that do a great job on this:
 
- [UserVoice](https://www.uservoice.com/)
- [GetSatisfication](https://getsatisfaction.com/corp/)
- [UserEcho](https://userecho.com/)

 ![ The UserVoice website allows user to enter suggestions (used here by SSW Code Auditor)![admin.jpg](admin.jpg) ](codeauditoruservoice.jpg) 
[UserVoice](https://www.uservoice.com/) is the most popular platform to collect, manage, and prioritize user feedback. It has a voting and tickets system out of the box.

Many software houses use this for their products Eg. SSW Code Auditor, SSW Link Auditor


Here are the google results as at 2014
