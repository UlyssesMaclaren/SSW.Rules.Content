A mnemonic for a button is the letter which has an underscore, and the user can press the button using Alt-.

In Windows Applications, it is quite easy to assign a mnemonic to a button with the "&" character.

So for the case above, the text would be:

btnAbout.Text = "&About"

**Tip:** In Windows XP the mnemonic display effects can be hidden by Default and then shown every time the user presses the Alt key.
