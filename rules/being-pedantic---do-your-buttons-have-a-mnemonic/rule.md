A mnemonic for a button is the letter which has an underscore, and the user can press the button using Alt-&lt;char&gt;.
   â€‹ <dl class="badImage"><dt>
      <img alt="Browse Button" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/BadMem.gif">
   </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example - All buttons without Mnemonic</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt>
      <img alt="Browse Button" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/GoodMem.gif">
   </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - All buttons with Mnemonic - user can easily choose which button they want without a click</dd></dl>
In Windows Applications, it is quite easy to assign a mnemonic to a button with the "&" character.

So for the case above, the text would be:
<dl class="code"><dt><p>btnAbout.Text = &quot;&amp;About&quot;</p>
   </dt></dl>
**Tip:** In Windows XP the mnemonic display effects can be hidden by Default and then shown every time the user presses the Alt key.
