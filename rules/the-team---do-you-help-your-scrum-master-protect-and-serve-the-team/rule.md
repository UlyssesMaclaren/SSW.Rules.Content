Part of the Scrum Master's (not ScrumMaster's) role is to protect the team from distractions so they can deliver on their commitment, to ensure agreed process is followed and to help all roles keep their promises.

It is also important that team members do not allow themselves to get distracted and must work based on priority. 

 Here is a good saying to remember: "It is very important I make my sprint. Can this wait 1 week until the next sprint?".

Any requests for work or distractions that take more than 15 minutes must be declined politely and the distraction notified to the ScrumMaster.  

 The only exceptions where a Team Member can start the work after notifying the Scrum Master are:

- Any Critical Production Issues that absolutely require the attention of the Team Member and nobody else is available
- A Client request for work when the Team Member is working on a internal project
- Test Please requests, if the total time taken from the Sprint for all Test Please requests is less than 8 hours


In these 3 exceptional cases only, even if the Team Member doesn't get a response from the Scrum Master the requestor can insist that the member starts the other work immediately.

Anything else must be politely declined and the request must be directed to the Scrum Master for the process of negotiating the work and any official meetings must be through the ScrumMaster.
