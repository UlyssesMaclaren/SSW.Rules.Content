<span class='intro'> 
  <p>There must always be <strong>*one* </strong>person who is responsible for the project getting into production. That person is the project manager.</p>
<p>SSW's Rules to Better Project Management, built on Scrum, allows businesses to address their most important challenges first, and respond quickly to a changing commercial environment. Whether you work on site or remotely, the key is good communication with the customer and users, becoming an integrated part of your team. <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterProjectManagement.aspx">Follow these rules and you will deliver functional, value-adding software - faster</a>.</p>
