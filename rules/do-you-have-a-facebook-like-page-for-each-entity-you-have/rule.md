<span class='intro'> This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). </span>


  <p>A Like Page should be available for each popular product or entity of your company. SSW has a fan page for the Rules section of our company but not a fan page for each individual product; on the other hand, it would be suitable for Microsoft to have a separate page for each of their products.<br>

<font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal" size="+0">Figure&#58; One of these pages is probably unnecessary. </font>
<p>Whether your product or entity requires a Like page depends largely on how effectively it will reach your target audience. Such pages usually have a high upkeep as you need to spend time to maintain your public image, responding to comments and posting updates reliably. It can be a profitable maneuver, but if this style of social networking does not reach out to your audience, then maintaining it is needless. </p>
