 SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010 ships with a fantastic document management feature "Managed Metadata Service". This new service provides first class support for enterprise taxonomy within a standard SharePoint 2010 environment. 

<br>Unfortunately, Office 2007 and Office 2003 can't work with managed metadata fields out of the box. 

Office 2010:1. Works fine


Office 2007:1. Document information can't display managed metadata
2. You can still save documents to SharePoint
3. But you can't check-in (if metadata fields are required)
4. User needs to perform a web check-in


Office 2003:1. Can't create new or Open documents with managed metadata
2. Install Office 2007 document support upgrade, this bring the experience a bit better similar to Office 2007.

Best Solution:

 Use a 3rd party solution - the best one being OnePlaceMail which provides a UI for managed metadata via the "Save to SharePoint". Works with all three versions of Office so users get a consistent UI.
