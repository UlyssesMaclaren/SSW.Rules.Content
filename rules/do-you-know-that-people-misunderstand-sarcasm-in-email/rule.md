From [Flame emails missing the mark](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/smh_flameemailsmissingthemark.htm) on the Sydney Morning Herald: "The senders of the [email] messages expected their partners to correctly interpret their tone nearly 80% of the time, but in fact, they only scored just over 50%... Those attempting to interpret the message believed they had scored 90%Â accuracy".

Because there is no "tone of voice" in an email, sarcasm can easily be misinterpreted by the receiver.

[greyBox]       "John, make sure your office is clean when clients come in - you might scare them away with all that mess."
  [/greyBox]
Bad example: This is bad because it may seem like John is being reprimanded, even though the sender may just be giving him a "heads up" for next time

[greyBox]  "John, make sure your office is clean when clients come in - you might scare them away with all that mess :)"
  [/greyBox]
Good example: When in doubt, use a smiley face at the end of the comment to soften it up a bit
