 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 
Because there is no "tone of voice" in an email, sarcasm can easily be misinterpreted by the receiver.

**Bad example:** "John, make sure your office is clean when clients come in - you might scare them away with all that mess."

This is bad because it may seem like John is being reprimanded, even though the sender may just be giving him a "heads up" for next time. When in doubt, use a smiley face at the end of the comment to soften it up a bit:

**Good example: **"John, make sure your office is clean when clients come in - you might scare them away with all that mess :)"
