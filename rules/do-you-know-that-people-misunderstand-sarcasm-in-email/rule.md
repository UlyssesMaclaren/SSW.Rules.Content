<span class='intro'> This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). </span>

<p>Because there is no &quot;tone of voice&quot; in an email, sarcasm can easily be misinterpreted by the receiver.</p>
<p><b>Bad example&#58;</b> &quot;John, make sure your office is clean when clients come in - you might scare them away with all that mess.&quot;</p>
<p>This is bad because it may seem like John is being reprimanded, even though the sender may just be giving him a &quot;heads up&quot; for next time. When in doubt, use a smiley face at the end of the comment to soften it up a bit&#58;</p>
