 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 
If you use a shortened link people can't see what they are clicking through to. In fact this is what most spamers rely on:

[http://twb.ly/1uJtUG](http&#58;//twb.ly/1uJtUG) 
Figure: Bad example - You don't know where this is going

When you can, take the more readable option:

[http://twibbon.com/join/Scotland](http&#58;//twibbon.com/join/Scotland) 
Figure: Better example - this link is sent in the clear as it is short enough

So you should only 'Auto Shorten URLs' when it is too long and you need the space.

However it is becoming more prevalent for the software to support showing the full URL on rollover.
