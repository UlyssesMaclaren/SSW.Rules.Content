<p>In Scrum you should conduct a separate “<a shape="rect" href="/Standards/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/InternalTestPlease.aspx"><font color="#000080">Test Please”</font></a>&#160;for each of the stories. You might be using the same package, but all the bugs and issues found must be rolled up to the <a shape="rect" href="/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx"><font color="#000080">Story Owner</font></a> as they will need to decide on what needs to be done to deliver their Story.</p>
