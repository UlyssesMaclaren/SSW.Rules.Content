Something you must do it to conduct an internal ”[Test Please](/do-you-conduct-a-＂test-please＂-internally-and-then-with-the-client)” prior to releasing anything to a client. This should be conducted by someone outside the Scrum Team and as it is a blocking process must be started within an hour and take no longer than 3 hours to complete.

**Rules to Successful Projects**

1. [Do you conduct an internal "test please" prior to releasing a version to a client?](/do-you-conduct-a-＂test-please＂-internally-and-then-with-the-client)
2. [Do you know the 4 steps to do a "Test Please"?](/do-you-know-the-tools-you-need-before-a-＂test-please＂)


In Scrum you should conduct a separate “[Test Please”](/do-you-conduct-a-＂test-please＂-internally-and-then-with-the-client) for each of the stories. You might be using the same package, but all the bugs and issues found must be rolled up to the [Story Owner](/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx) as they will need to decide on what needs to be done to deliver their Story.
