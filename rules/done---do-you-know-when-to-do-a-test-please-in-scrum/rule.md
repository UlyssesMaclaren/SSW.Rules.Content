 Something that SSW has always done is to conduct an internal ”[Test Please](/Standards/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/InternalTestPlease.aspx)” prior to releasing anything to a client. This should be conducted by someone outside the Scrum Team and as it is a blocking process must be started within an hour and take no longer than 3 hours to complete.<br> 
**Rules to Successful Projects**

1. Do you conduct an internal "test please" prior to releasing a version to a client?
2. [Do you know the 4 steps to do a "Test Please"?](/Standards/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/TestPleaseFourSteps.aspx)


In Scrum you should conduct a separate “[Test Please”](/Standards/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/InternalTestPlease.aspx) for each of the stories. You might be using the same package, but all the bugs and issues found must be rolled up to the [Story Owner](/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx) as they will need to decide on what needs to be done to deliver their Story.
