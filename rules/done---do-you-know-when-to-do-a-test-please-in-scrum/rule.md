 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 
**Rules to Successful Projects**

1. [Do you conduct an internal "test please" prior to releasing a version to a client?](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/#TestPlease)
2. [Do you know the 4 steps to do a "Test Please"?](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/#TestPlease4Steps)


In Scrum you should conduct a separate “[Test Please”](/Standards/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/InternalTestPlease.aspx) for each of the stories. You might be using the same package, but all the bugs and issues found must be rolled up to the [Story Owner](/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx) as they will need to decide on what needs to be done to deliver their Story.
