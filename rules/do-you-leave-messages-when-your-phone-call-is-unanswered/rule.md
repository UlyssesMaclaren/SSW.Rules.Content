 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 
Your messages must contain ***your name (firstname and lastname)***,***purpose of calling***, and*** your contact number***. Below ia a good messages example:

*Hi Ms. Emma, this is Alvin Shen from SSW. I am calling to follow up our meeting yesterday about your company website. Please return my call on 9953 3000. Thank you.* 

Confirm the voice message with an email.

There are several advantages leaving messages when your call is unanswered:

- He/she may know who calls and be able to return your call.
- If your message is urgent, he/she may return your call straight away (even though he/she is VERY busy).
