Source control is your backup of your code, as well as your change history to track changes. 
<br>With the source control (we use TFS), we can share project code and cooperate with other team members. Using it allows us to track changes, compare code and even roll-back if required. Moreover, it keeps our code safe that is the most important. <br> ![ View the changes in source control on each individual file ![](HistoryCompareMenu.jpg) ](HistoryWindow.jpg) 
![ Right click file and select Annotate to view the history on a segment basis ![](Annotate.jpg)](AnnotateMenu.jpg)

Don't just fix the problem, see who caused the problem and correct them.
