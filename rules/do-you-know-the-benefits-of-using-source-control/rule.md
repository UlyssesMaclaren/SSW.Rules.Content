 Source control is your backup of your code, as well as your change history to track changes. 
<br>With the source control (we use TFS), we can share project code and cooperate with other team members. Using it allows us to track changes, compare code and even roll-back if required. Moreover, it keeps our code safe that is the most important. <br> ![](/TFS/RulesToBetterVersionControlwithTFS(AKASourceControl)/PublishingImages/HistoryWindow.jpg)Â Figure: View the changes in source control on each individual file ![](/TFS/RulesToBetterVersionControlwithTFS(AKASourceControl)/PublishingImages/HistoryCompareMenu.jpg) Figure: We can select different changesets and compare the changes ![](/TFS/RulesToBetterVersionControlwithTFS(AKASourceControl)/PublishingImages/Compare.jpg) Figure: We can select different changesets and compare the changes. Blue = modified, Green = addition, Red = deletion

Don't just fix the problem, see who caused the problem and correct them.
