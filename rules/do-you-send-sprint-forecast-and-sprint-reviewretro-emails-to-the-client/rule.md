Each sprint has a "Sprint plan" email that details what will be worked on during this sprint. At the end of the sprint, this should be replied to with a breakdown of what was completed.

Each sprint has the following stages:
 


1. Planning meeting
\* The Sprint plan email: "Northwind Sprint 5 Plan"
2. Review and Retro meetings
​​\* The Sprint review/retro email: "Northwind Sprint 5 Review/Retro"
\* Include the Sprint Plan in the history
\* Include significant notes from the Retro
\* Any other notes that the stakeholder might need to know


The goal of this email is to inform disconnected stakeholders (depending on what notes you include) info that will answer the following questions:

- The location of the new package you built last Friday
- The % of the tasks done? (Find this from your current iteration)
- The % of the budget spent? (Find from your Billing System. [See example of a Billing Report - Project Progress Report](/Management/RulesToManagingSoftwareConsultants/Pages/DoYouGetRegularUpdatesOnCostsAndProgress.aspx))
- Expected finish date
