Each sprint has a "Sprint Forecast" email that details what will be worked on during this sprint.

At the end of the sprint, this should be replied to with a "Sprint Review" email that shows a breakdown of what was completed.

Each sprint has the following stages:
 
1. Planning meeting:
    - Sprint Forecast email: "Northwind Sprint 5 Forecast"
    - See [Do you send a Sprint Forecast Email](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/Do-you-have-a-Sprint-Contract-aka-The-deal-between-the-Product-Owner-and-Team.aspx) for more details
2. The work is done:
    - Done emails are sent asking for specific functionality to be tested
    - See [Rules to better Email](/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail)for details
3. Review and Retro meetings
    - The Sprint review/retro email: "Northwind Sprint 5 Review/Retro"
    - See [Do you send a Sprint Review/Retro email](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/Do-you-create-a-Sprint-Review-email.aspx "Do you send a Sprint Review/Retro email") for more details.
