You can save time and reduce human error by automatically generating clients for your APIs.

<!--endintro-->

The best tool for this is [NSwag](https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag).

This is Microsoft's recommended approach, and you can read more about how to set this up in your ASP.Net Core project at [the official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/getting-started-with-nswag?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio).

If you use the Clean Architecture template developed by SSW's @JasonTaylorDev, this is built in out of the box. See our [rule on getting started with clean architecture](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=ae1a999d-0c34-45d7-af89-7d50a9939370).
