Often we use Azure VM's for presentations, training and development. As there cost involved to store and use the VM it is important to ensure that the VM is shutdown when it is no longer required. This will prevent compute charges from incurring. There is still a cost involved for the storage of the VHD files but these charges are a lot less than the compute charges.

The following is stated on [http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits/](http&#58;//www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits/) Stop your virtual machines and we will stop billing them within a minute. ​
