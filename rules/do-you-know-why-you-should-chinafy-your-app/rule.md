China is a booming market and now is the time to take advantage of this growing user base. If you have a successful application you should bring it to the Chinese market.



Most Chinese consumers will not make a purchase or use your application if information is not easily available in Chinese.


### Benefits



You can grow and target your audience better using the local social media networks




You should ensure your application works in China, and that critical application resources are not blocked by the firewall




You should integrate with local services (such as video streaming)




Localizing for the market is not just translation
