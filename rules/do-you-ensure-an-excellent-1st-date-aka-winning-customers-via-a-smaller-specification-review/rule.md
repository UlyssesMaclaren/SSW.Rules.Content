So you had a good initial meeting (like a 1st coffee with a new girl), and you have agreed to have a Specification Review (aka first date).
 
For the majority of new clients, a [Specification Review](/Management/RulesToBetterProjectManagement/Pages/SpecificationReview.aspx) (also known as a Spec Review) will be your 1st paid engagement with them. This is to work out the requirements,                      and put together a broad time and cost estimate.

The process:

1. Once you have decided that this is a project you want to work on, you have to convince the client to book in a Spec Review
    - This is a 1-5 day exercise for 1-2 people. The general rule is 1 man day per expected 2 week sprint.
    - This process is timeboxed, and so appears to the client as a fixed price.
2. Make sure you get [terms and conditions](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/forms/ConsultingOrderTermsConditions.aspx) signed before you start work on this.
3. You will create a backlog of tasks, and some form of document (word or ppt) to present to the client explaining your proposed approach.
4. Present the Spec Review results to the client (in a meeting with all stakeholders) on site if possible, <br>                        or over the phone if not, but never just by email.
