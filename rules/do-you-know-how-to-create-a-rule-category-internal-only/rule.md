 ** Note: **
William is going to take the control back of updating “rule categories” for a few weeks, as we had some issues with the rule categories management​ when everyone can update them. This issue will be sorted out in the next few weeks, during this period, please email to William Yin if you need to create/update a rule summary page or need to create/update a rule category.
​





The rule structure is http://rules.ssw.com.au/RuleCategory/Rule-SubCategory/Pages/rule-title.aspx.



Here is how you create a **new** **rule category (or subcategory) :**

**
**

 
1. Log in to [http://rules.ssw.com.au/admin/Pages/default.aspx](/admin/Pages/default.aspx)
2. It depends on which level of 'rule category' you are going to create, please make sure you have navigate to the correct site level, E.g if you are going to create a "rules to better something" subcategory under “Communication” category, please go to http://rules.ssw.com.au/Communicatio n/Pages/default.aspx before you action the below steps.
**Note:** It's very **important **to make sure you are at the right location before creating a rule category !!!
3. Click on "Site contents"
<dl class="image" style="text-decoration&#58;line-through;"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/site-content.jpg" alt="site-content.jpg"> </dt></dl>
4. Scroll down and click on "new subsite"
<dl class="image" style="text-decoration&#58;line-through;"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/subsites.jpg" alt="subsites.jpg"> </dt></dl>
5. Fill the form with the title and URL complement (keep all the ratio buttons as default)
<dl class="image" style="text-decoration&#58;line-through;"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/subsite-form.jpg" alt="subsite-form.jpg"> </dt></dl>


This is how you **edit/update** an existing rule category:

1. Go to the rule category index (E.g. http://rules.ssw.com.au/Management)
2. Click on "Site settings"
<dl class="image" style="text-decoration&#58;line-through;"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/site-settings.jpg" alt="site-settings.jpg"> </dt></dl>
3. Click on "Title, description, and logo" under "Look and feel" section
<dl class="image" style="text-decoration&#58;line-through;"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/site-settings-title.jpg" alt="site-settings-title.jpg"> </dt></dl>
4. Make your changes and press "OK"
