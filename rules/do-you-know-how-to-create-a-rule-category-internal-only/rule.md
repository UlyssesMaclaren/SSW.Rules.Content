 ** Note: **
William is going to take the control back of updating “rule categories” for a few weeks, as we had some issues with the rule categories when everyone can update them. I’m going to sort this issue out in the next few weeks, during this period, please email to me if you need to create/update a rule summary page or need to create/update a rule category.
​





The rule structure is http://rules.ssw.com.au/RuleCategory/Rule-SubCategory/Pages/rule-title.aspx.



Here is how you create a **new** **rule category (or subcategory) :**

**
**

 
1. Log in to [http://rules.ssw.com.au/admin/Pages/default.aspx](/admin/Pages/default.aspx)
2. It depends on which level of 'rule category' you are going to create, please make sure you have navigate to the correct site level, E.g if you are going to create a "rules to better something" subcategory under “Communication” category, please go to http://rules.ssw.com.au/Communicatio n/Pages/default.aspx before you action the below steps.
**Note:** It's very **important **to make sure you are at the right location before creating a rule category !!!
3. Click on "Site contents"
