 It is important to frame a product presentation with solid introduction and closing statements. 
 
**​Intro:** “Hi, I’m Steve here to show you what I just did”
**Closing:** “Thanks for watching”
​​Figure: Bad example - This closing statement ends the video abruptly, and doesn’t leave the viewer satisfied​
**Intro:** “Hi, I’m Steve from SSW and I’m going to show you how our latest feature – the project breakdown report – can give you an overview of where your employees are spending their time.​
**Closing:** “I’ve just demonstrated the usefulness of a project breakdown report to understand what it is your employees are working on”
​​​Figure: Good example - The opening and closing statements back each other up, and give the demonstration a sense of purpose​
