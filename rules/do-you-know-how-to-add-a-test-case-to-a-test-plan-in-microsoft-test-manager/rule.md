You organize your Test Cases by adding them to a Test Plan (also called a Test Sâ€‹uite).
 
We have one Test Plan per sprint.

![ Select Plan from the main menu, and then choose the Test Plan that you would like to add Test Cases to](add-tc-to-tp-1.jpg)

![ Add a filter to make it easy to find your Test Cases. Click the Run button, select the relevant items and click the 'Add Test Cases' button](add-tc-to-tp-2.jpg)

![ Your Test Case has now been added to the suite](add-tc-to-tp-3.jpg)
