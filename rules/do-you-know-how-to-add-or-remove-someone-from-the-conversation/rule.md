 If you think someone should be involved in a conversation but they're not on the recipient list, all you need to do is reply all, put the new recipient in the 'CC' field, and include one line that says "I'm adding this person into the loop because I think they may have some input."<br> ![Add Recipient](/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/AddRecipient.jpg) Figure: Good Example - Adding someone to an email thread
If you need to remove someone from the loop, for example to have an internal conversation about an email to a client, put (Removing xxx from the loop) at the top of the email.

You can delete people from an email thread, but what often happens is:

- The people being dropped won’t know and won’t be able to say "I don't want to be dropped from this thread"
- The people who added them in the 1st place don't know that they included unnecessary people
- The others on the thread might not notice the change in email addresses


To fix all these issues, instead of deleting people from the email, you:

- Move them to the BCC
- On the top line of the body say "(moving George and Bob to BCC)"
