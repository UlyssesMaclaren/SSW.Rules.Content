 If you think someone should be involved in a conversation but they're not on the recipient list, all you need to do is reply all, put the new recipient in the 'CC' field, and include one line that says "I'm adding this person into the loop because I think they may have some input."<br> ![Add Recipient](/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/AddRecipient.jpg) Figure: Good Example - Adding someone to an email thread
If you need to remove someone from the loop, for example to have an internal conversation about an email to a client, put (Removing xxx from the loop) at the top of the email.
