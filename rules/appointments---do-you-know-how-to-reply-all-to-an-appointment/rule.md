 Some people have Outlook calendars that are full to the brim. They might use their Calendar to remind them to do certain personal tasks, they might have an appointment telling them that someone else is going on leave, and, of course, they have actual meetings with clients or colleagues. Their calendars can get very messy and it's easy to miss s​omething important. 



This is why, when working with someone who has a hectic calendar like this, you might want to remind them by email of your meeting the day before it is scheduled. 





Outlook makes this easy:
