Often your conversation flow with someone will go from a phone call, to emails, to an appointment, and then back to emails.

It's nice to be able to look back and see the whole history in 1 thread, so you will need to be able to Reply All to an appointment to continue the email conversation after the meeting.

Outlook makes this easy:
 
![ Open the appointment in your Calendar ](Outlook 1.png)
(You should already have Invited all the required people to attend)
![ Click on "Contact Attendees" | "Reply to All with Email" if you created the appointment, or "Respond" | "Reply All" if you were invited](Outlook 2.png)


![ Send a friendly reminder](Outlook 3.png)
!

Reasons you might want to Reply All to an Appointment include:

1. Continuing the conversation after a meeting
2. Reminding someone about an upcoming meeting (especially if you know they have unwieldy calendars)
3. Getting more information before a meeting
