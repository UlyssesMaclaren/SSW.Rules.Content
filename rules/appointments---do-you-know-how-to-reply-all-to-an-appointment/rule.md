Often your conversation flow with someone will go from a phone call, to emails, to an appointment, and then back to emails.

It's nice to be able to look back and see the whole history in 1 thread, so you will need to be able to Reply All to an appointment to continue the email conversation after the meeting.

Outlook makes this easy:
 <dl class="image"><dt>
      <img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" alt="Calendar window" src="Outlook 1.png" style="width:790px;height:513px;">
   </dt><dd>Figure: Open the appointment in your Calendar (You should already have Invited all the required people to attend)</dd></dl><dl class="image"><dt>
      <img src="Outlook 2.png" alt="" style="width:789px;height:324px;">
      <br>
   </dt><dd>Figure: Click on "Contact Attendees" | "Reply to All with Email" if you created the appointment, or "Respond" | "Reply All" if you were invited<br></dd></dl><dl class="image"><dt>
      <img alt="Type the messages" src="Outlook 3.png" style="width:652px;"> 
   </dt><dd>Figure: Send a friendly reminder!<br></dd></dl>
Reasons you might want to Reply All to an Appointment include:

1. Continuing the conversation after a meeting
2. Reminding someone about an upcoming meeting (especially if you know they have unwieldy calendars)â€‹
3. Getting more information before a meeting
