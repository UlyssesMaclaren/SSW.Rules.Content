When you notice that someone has done something against our standards, make sure                     you are tactful in your corrections; especially if the person you are correcting                     is a client.

<br>                        Hi Mary,

<br>                        FYI - an appointment would have been better. See rule #48 in [Rules to better Email](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=35452dab-3ce2-469d-8642-9e64eaa6b6f6)                         Figure: Bad ExampleSubject RE: Meeting

<br>                        Hi Mary,

<br>                        I noticed you did not send an appointment for this meeting. I hope you don't mind,<br>                        but I have gone ahead and created one so we don't all have to create one individually.<br>                        
<br>                        We have a number of helpful standards like this which you can have a look at in<br>                        our [Rules to<br>                            better Email](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=35452dab-3ce2-469d-8642-9e64eaa6b6f6) if you're interested.
