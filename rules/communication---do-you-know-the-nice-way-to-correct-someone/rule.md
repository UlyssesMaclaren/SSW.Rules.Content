​​​When you notice that someone has done something that could have been done better, make sure you are tactful in your correction/suggestions. When you are giving someone a correction or tip, try to include an URL to back up your point.

For example, if someone sends you an email like that:
 
**Subject: Meeting**
​
Hi Guys,
 ​
Let's meet on Thursday at 3 PM
 Figure: Someone requests a meeting

​​

You could reply in different ways:

**Subject: RE: Meeting**

Hi Mary,
 ​
FYI - an appointment would have been better. See rule #48 in [Rules to better Email](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=35452dab-3ce2-469d-8642-9e64eaa6b6f6)

**Subject RE: Meeting**

Hi Mary,

I noticed you did not send an appointment for this meeting. I hope you don't mind, but I have gone ahead and created one so we don't all have to create one individually. 
We have a number of helpful standards like this which you can have a look at in our [Rules to better Email](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=35452dab-3ce2-469d-8642-9e64eaa6b6f6) if you're interested.
