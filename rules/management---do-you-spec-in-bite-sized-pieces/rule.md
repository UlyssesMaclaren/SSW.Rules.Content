The first problem with specs is that nobody writes them. Joel Spolsky [says](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/JoelOnSoftwareSpecs.htm) ![Leave Site](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Images/LeaveSite.gif)

"Writing specs is like flossing: everyone agrees that it's a good thing, but nobody does it". We know developers like writing code more than specs, but the rule is developers don't code without a spec (including a release plan).

The second problem is that when people do write them, they try and spec the whole project, spending months detailing every Use Case, Business Rule and Process Flow Diagram. The client spends lots of money and sees no real progress, and the requirements change and the process begins again.

For example, if your client wants an application that manages Customers and Customer Projects, get the whole Customer phase up and running before you get Customer Projects running. This way you have two 1 month deadlines, instead of 1 two month deadline.

At SSW we spec in two phases, the first to get an overview of the project, the second, to focus on the detail of first few releases only:

- [Spec Review, or Initial Release Plan](/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterProjectManagement/Pages/InitialReleasePlanandBallpark.aspx)
- [Detailed Release Plan](/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterProjectManagement/Pages/DetailedReleasePlan.aspx) - this phase is repeated through the project
