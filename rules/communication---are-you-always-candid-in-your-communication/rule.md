It is extremely important to maintain honesty and candor​ in a team environment. Sometimes this means admitting when you're uncertain and not just communicating wishful thinking.

Nothing breaks down a team like a lack of trust. Remember, honesty starts with the small things.
 
You also need to make sure you qualify​ your level of certainty in an answer, so that your guess (which could be wrong) does not end up misleading someone.

e.g. "Is the database corrupt?"

Bad example: No.

Good Example: I don't think so but I'd need investigate further to be sure.
