When creating links, you should follow a few basic rules:
 
1. If your link is an internal link, then it should navigate within the same window. If the link is external, it should open in a new tab and be visually clear to the user that it will lead them away from the current site, that way it is not a surprise.
2. If a link is to an external site, a <br>       **visual indication**  should be provided to the user like this: <br>      [This is a link to another site](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/Microsoft/microsoft.htm). <br>      
[greyBox]
 Search Engines ([http://www.google.com](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/Web/Google.htm) is by far the best but try other search engines as well) 
[/greyBox]
Figure: Bad example - Without visual indication

3. External link <br>       **external indicators should be inserted by CSS**  as following: <br>      
a[href\*="//"]:not([href\*="mysite.com"]):after {              
    content: url(https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/images/external.gif);              
    padding-left: 4px;
}
Figure: Good example - Icon is added by CSS via a simple declaration


We have a program called     [SSW Code Auditor](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/) to check for this rule.
