 When preparing a Boot to VHD image it is important to know the size of the partition which is setup inside the VHD file – you should make a note of this when you create the VHD image. The reason for this is because the VHD file will expand to the size of the partition **INSIDE **the VHD.<br> 
For Example:

- A Windows installation called **WindowsInVHD **inside the VHD file has a partition size of 60GB.
- It is copied to the D:\ drive of a laptop called **Frog **and only takes up 10GB of space (as it is a dynamic expanding VHD).
- When you boot into **WindowsInVHD **(the VHD sitting on **Frog’s **D:\ drive), the VHD file expands to 60GB - the partition size of **WindowsInVHD.**
- This means you will need at least 60GB of free space on **Frog’s **D:\ drive free


If you do not have free space equal to the size of the partition inside the VHD image, you will get a blue screen telling you that you are out of hard drive space.
