Make sure you follow these steps when preparing your presentation to ensure your work is of the highest quality... and don't forget to archive your presentation on Slideshare!

- Prepare your PowerPoint as normally.
- Remember to store all versions of your PowerPoint in SharePoint so that a record of your work may be kept.
- Get your work checked by a Tester for content and a designer for visual appearances.
- Add a slide that contain information on where to find the slides on Slideshare – incase your audience wishes to access your PowerPoint later.
- Once your presentation has been finalized, add a version number on the first slide before uploading the document to Slideshare (this will help you know later what version is on Slideshare and if it needs to be updated)
- Before you are ready to present, add a text file in SharePoint that links to the Slideshare url (at SSW we use the naming format “\_OnSlideshare.txt”)
- Present! And have fun.
