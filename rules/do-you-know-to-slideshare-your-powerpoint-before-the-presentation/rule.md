Make sure you follow these steps when preparing your presentation to ensure your work is of the highest quality... and don't forget to archive your presentation on Slideshare!

1. Prepare your PowerPoint
2. Put it in SharePoint for the versioning
3. Get it tested by a Tester (for the content)
4. Get it tested by a Designer (so it looks good)
5. Add a generic Slideshare link to the last slide
6. Add the version number on the first page (this will help you later know what version is on slideshare)
7. Check the name of the ppt eg. SharePoint-Jonah-Lomu-of-CMS\_Adam-Cogan\_V1-0.pptx
8. Upload to Slideshare
<br>    Eg. [http://www.slideshare.net/CraigBailey/sharepoint-as-a-web-cms](http&#58;//www.slideshare.net/CraigBailey/sharepoint-as-a-web-cms) ![](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/images/external.gif "You are now leaving SSW")
9. In sharepoint add a \_OnSlideShare.txt with the url inside it
10. Now you are ready to present
