 ​It is helpful to the viewers to include still or animated captions (also known as lower thirds) in your videos because they enhance or add extra information that is not fully explained by the speakers. These are not to be confused with *titles,*which is the term given to text that appears on screen, such as the opening film credits, or "1985 - New York City". ![CTA_Bad_Example_2.jpg](/DesignandPresentation/RulesToBetterVideoRecording/PublishingImages/CTA_Bad_Example_2.jpg)Figure: Bad example of captions - Text is too small and hard to read.![CTA_Good_Example_2.jpg](/DesignandPresentation/RulesToBetterVideoRecording/PublishingImages/CTA_Good_Example_2.jpg)Figure: Good example of Captions - Text is clear and legible. Provides extra value to the viewer with content not mentioned in the video​
Now you cant really have just one type of caption. Have defined styles for different types of videos

eg. Here are the styles SSW use for their videos:
​![Why Choose SSW.jpg](/DesignandPresentation/RulesToBetterVideoRecording/PublishingImages/Why%20Choose%20SSW.jpg)Figure: Good example of titles - Clear, nice effects and well stylized. This is the style used for SSW Infomercials![Good titles example.png](/DesignandPresentation/RulesToBetterVideoRecording/PublishingImages/Good%20titles%20example.png)Figure: Good example of titles - this is the style used for SSW TV videos![SSWRules_LowerThirdsExample.jpg](/DesignandPresentation/RulesToBetterVideoRecording/PublishingImages/SSWRules_LowerThirdsExample.jpg)Figure: Good example of titles - this is the style used for SSW Rules Videos![CaseStudy_LowerThirds.jpg](/DesignandPresentation/RulesToBetterVideoRecording/PublishingImages/CaseStudy_LowerThirds.jpg)Figure: Good example of titles - this is the style used for SSW Case Studies
Remember to put any links that you've mentioned in the captions underneath your video in it's own section (with a heading such as 'Show Notes' or 'Related Content'). You can also use this section to put in links that are related to what was said in the video as evidence (similar to footnotes or a bibliography in a book). That way, you will gain more Google juice and it will make it easier for the Product Owner to review your captions.
