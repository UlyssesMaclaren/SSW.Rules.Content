<span class='intro'> Do you check-in with your boss in the morning to make sure you are both on the same page?<br> </span>

<p>​</p><p>Having a daily scrum, or check-in with your boss in the morning will make sure that you are both ready for the day to come.&#160;​Rather than telling them what they have on, ask them what their appointments are for the day. This should help them remember what they have on throughout the day&#160;and with whom they are meeting.<br></p><p>It is during this time that&#160;you can also&#160;tell them what you will be working on for that day, to ensure that you are working on the most important tasks.&#160;​<br></p><p>If your boss is away, you can still check-in via phone or on Microsoft&#160;Teams.&#160;Try sending&#160;them&#160;an instant message via Teams first&#160;and let them know that you are trying to get hold of them.&#160;​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Tip">Tip&#58;</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Say&#160;&quot;I'm calling you in 10 minutes if you don't answer!&quot;<br></p><p><br></p>
