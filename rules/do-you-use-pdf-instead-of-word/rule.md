When providing a proposal to a client it should be in PDF format. Reasons for this are:
 
- PDFs cannot be edited without leaving a digital footprint
- PDF is a universal file format across different OS'
- File Size is decreased
- Reading is free and is now built into browser, requring no unique software to view
