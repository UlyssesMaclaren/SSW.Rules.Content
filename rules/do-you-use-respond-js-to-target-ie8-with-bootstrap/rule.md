It's great when you can target modern browsers for your web application, but what happens when you want Bootstrap to work in older browsers, such as Internet Explorer 8?
   ​ 
Include Respond JS in your application, after Bootstrap. Respond JS enables responsive web designs in browsers which don't support CSS3 Media Queries.

***Note****: Respond JS will be included in a new MVC5 Web Application. If you are working on an existing application, you can get it from NuGet or [https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond​](https&#58;//github.com/scottjehl/Respond).*
