<span class='intro'> It is not a good idea to have Windows Update automatically updating your servers.&#160; There are a few reasons. 
<br><br> </span>


  
<ol>
    <li>The hotfix could bring down a production environment. (This issue previously happened)<br></li>
    <li>In fact, even in a development environment this could be hours of lost work as the development team struggles to understand why only <strong>some</strong> of the developers' servers&#160;<strong>magically and mysteriously </strong>broke overnight.<br></li>
    <li>Windows Update could restart your server, or put your server in a state where it requires restarting - preventing any urgent MSI installs without bringing down the server.</li>
</ol>
<p>Windows Update remains the best thing for end-users to protect their systems.&#160; But in a server, especially a production server environment - Windows Update patches are just like any new versions of the software that's built internally.&#160; It should be tested and then deployed in a controlled manner.<br>
<br>So recommendations for managing updates are as follows&#58;</p>
<ol>
    <li>Use WSUS to approve/deny updates for your servers.<br></li><li>Update Staging/Development servers first to see if any issues arise from the updates.<br></li><li>Roll these updates out to Production once confident there are no issuesâ€‹.<br></li><li>Windows Updates may be critical and should be kept relatively up to date.<br></li>
</ol>
