<span class='intro'> It is not a good idea to have Windows Update automatically updating your servers.&#160; There are a few reasons. 
<br><br> </span>


  
<ol>
    <li>The hotfix could bring down a production environment. (This issue previously happened)<br></li>
    <li>In fact, even in a development environment this could be hours of lost work as the development team struggles to understand why only <strong>some</strong> of the developers' servers&#160;<strong>magically and mysteriously </strong>broke overnight.<br></li>
    <li>Windows Update could restart your server, or put your server in a state where it requires restarting - preventing any urgent MSI installs without bringing down the server.</li>
</ol>
<p>Windows Update remains the best thing for end-users to protect their systems.&#160; But in a server, especially a production server environment - Windows Update patches are just like any new versions of the software that's built internally.&#160; It should be tested and then deployed in a controlled manner.<br>
<br>So recommendations&#58;</p>
<ol>
    <li>Windows Updates may be critical and should be kept relatively up to date.</li>
    <li>Have a plan where your awesome Network Admins schedule time to keep the servers up to date - including testing that the servers still perform its functions.<br></li>
    <li>Turn off Automatic Windows Update on Windows Servers<br></li>
</ol>
