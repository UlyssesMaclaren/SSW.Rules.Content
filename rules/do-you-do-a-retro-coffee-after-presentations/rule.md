Presentations at User Groups and other events are great for connecting with the developer community. After giving a presentation, you should always follow up with a few attendees to get feedback, find out what projects they’re working on, and potentially how you can help.
 
Pick a few attendees at random to follow up with, give them a call and ask if you can buy them a coffee. You should ask them:

- What they thought of the session and whether they have any feedback
- Whether there are any related topics they’d like to learn more about
- What projects they are working on at the moment
- Whether there are any issues they’re having with those projects
