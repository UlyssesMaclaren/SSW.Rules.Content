 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 
2. Make sure you are showing the version column in your document view. ![Add a version column](/Standards/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterSharePoint/PublishingImages/VersionColumn_Small.jpg)

TIP: You can add the column by selecting Modify View

3. Whenever you edit the document and check it in, SharePoint will automatically increase the version number.
4. If you need to send this document to a client then it is important to:
       a. Save the file locally by selecting Send To | Download a Copy ![Save a file locally ](/Standards/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterSharePoint/PublishingImages/SaveFileLocally_Small.jpg)

b. Add the version to the end of the filename e.g. Specifications\_v2.0.docx
       c. Then email it to the client.
       d. We do this so that we can track what version of the document was sent to the client.

TIP: If you are not working with SharePoint then we recommend you follow the rule [Do you include version numbers in your file names?](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterTechnicalDocumentation.aspx#VersionNumber)
