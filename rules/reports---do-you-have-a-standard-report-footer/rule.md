When designing custom applications you want to include branding on reports.                      There are two ways to design a standard footer. As a minimum, you can have a                      line "Generated from [e.g.] SSW SQL Deploy - www.ssw.com.au".
 
Or, even better, you can send or keep detailed information about the report for you and your company:
<dl class="image"><dt> 
      <img src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/BetterInterface_ReportFooter.jpg" alt="ssw Report Footer" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;650px;">
   </dt></dl>
