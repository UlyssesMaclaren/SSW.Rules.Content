 When you look at the Service Calendar, you want to be able to see, at a glance, who is working on what.



​To do this, the subject field of the appointments should be as follows:

   Client [Project] - Name[s]




The project name is optional and only used if there is more than one project happening simultaneously.

You can have 1 or many names, dep​ending on the booking




ACME Corp - Mehmet
 ACME Corp - Mehmet, Dan
ACME Corp (SharePoint) - Dan

<dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure&#58;&#160;Good Examples</dd>


The same format should also be used for leave requests.




Leave - Mehmet
<dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good&#160;Example&#58;&#160;</dd>
