When you look at the Service Calendar, you want to be able to see, at a glance, who is working on what.



To do this, the subject field of the appointments should be as follows:

   Client [Project] - Name[s]




The project name (in parentheses) is optional and only used if there is more than one project happening simultaneously.

You can have 1 or many names, depending on the booking




[greyBox]  Go to ACME Corp
Work onsite for ACME Corp
Mehmet working at ACME Corp
  [/greyBox]

Figure: Bad example - all inconsistent and hard to read
[greyBox]  ACME Corp - Mehmet
 ACME Corp - Mehmet, Dan
ACME Corp (SharePoint) - Dan  [/greyBox]

Figure: Good Examples


The same format should also be used for leave requests ([the same for normal calendar appointments/invitations](/appointments-do-you-show-all-the-necessary-information-in-the-subject)).




[greyBox]  Leave - Mehmet
  [/greyBox]
