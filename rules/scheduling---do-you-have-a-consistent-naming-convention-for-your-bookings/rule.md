When you look at the Service Calendar, you want to be able to see, at a glance, who is working on what.



​To do this, the subject field of the appointments should be as follows:

   Client [Project] - Name[s]




The project name (in parentheses) is optional and only used if there is more than one project happening simultaneously.

You can have 1 or many names, dep​ending on the booking




Go to ACME Corp​​
Work onsite for ACME Corp
Mehmet working at ACME Corp

ACME Corp - Mehmet
 ACME Corp - Mehmet, Dan
ACME Corp (SharePoint) - Dan

The same format should also be used for leave requests ([the same for nor​mal calendar appointments/invitations](/appointments-do-you-show-all-the-necessary-information-in-the-subject)).




Leave - Mehmet
