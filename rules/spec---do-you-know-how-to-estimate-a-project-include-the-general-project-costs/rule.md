Estimates contain two main classes of work: Work relating to the particular product (e.g. Create Customers.aspx) and work relating to the project as a whole (e.g. management, administration, testing, software audit etc).

PBIs may only make up about 60% of the total project time. Project Managers and developers should not think that the only work being charged on a project are coding tasks.
 
**General Project Costs 
**Management costs can change depending on how much management the client requires. SSW will recommend a suitable level of management. 'Management', or to put it another way: 'accountability and transparency' has a cost.

At SSW we add general project costs as a % of the work items generally in line with the following:

- Testing: 10-20%
- Fixes from testing: 10-20%
- Software Audit: 4 hours per Release - usually conducted by two experienced Architects
- Fixes from the Software Audit: 5%
- Project Administration: 5% - this includes items like stand up meetings, timesheets, standard updates
- Project Management: at least 1 day per week per resource on the project (e.g. two developers full time requires a PM two days per week) UNLESS the client provides a full time Project Manager and takes full responsibility for all resources
- Unknowns: 10%. While this is arbitrary it raises awareness for everybody that 'there are things we still don't know!'


**Project Specific Costs **

At SSW, estimates for a project will be done by a developer, checked by another developer, and finally triple checked by a project manager. While every project is different in some way, there are common elements. SSW has built an estimates calculator to assist in creating estimates.

See the [SSW Menu Estimates Calculator](/Pages/ReleaseEstimationProcess.aspx)(NOTE: this is an Excel template file.  Save the File ("Save as" don't "Open" it) and then open the file in Windows Explorer!)

If the client requires a fixed price quotation a 20% premium is added to the estimates for the sprints specified in the Specification Release only (i.e. a fixed price is not given on the entire project). Requests for variations to a fixed price contract must wait until the contract is completed. If development is based on a fixed price contract, work is completed offsite only to facilitate project management and prevent unauthorized scope development.​

Note: It would be great if TFS had functionality “Add [Standard Items](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/BetterSoftwareSuggestions/TeamFoundationServer.aspx#StandardItems)to a Iteration (aka Sprint, Release etc.)”
