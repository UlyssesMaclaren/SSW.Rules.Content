 ​​​​If you are working with Sitefinity, then use Sitefin​ity Thunder. 
​

​Sitefi​nity Thunder integrates with Visual Studio and provides rich functionality to develop and deploy custom Sitefinity changes.

For example:

- allows developers to automatically deploy custom code to multiple Sitefinity projects​
- accelerates custom development by connecting to Sitefinity instances inside Visual Studio. Once connected, Sitefinity Thunder supports a wide range of activities, including: modifying templates, deploying widgets, updating themes and much more
- provides easy deployment to Azure through the Deploy to Azure wizard​
