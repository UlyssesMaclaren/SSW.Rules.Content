![ Bad example - Every developer commits to the master branch, code is not reviewed, and code quality is poor![github-pullrequest-bad-2.png](github-pullrequest-bad.png)](github-pullrequest-bad-2.png)
Figure: Bad example - Use the out of the box pull requests to ensure all code is reviewed 
 ![ Good example - Use the plugin "Reviewable". Reviewable improves pull requests and code reviews with a powerful UI and easy code commenting. See the Reviewable icon above ![github-pullrequest-2.png](github-pullrequest-2.png)](github-pullrequest-1.png)
Figure: See how easy it is to see the code rejected
