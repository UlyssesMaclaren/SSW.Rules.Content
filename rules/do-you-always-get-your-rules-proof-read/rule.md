It is important to have high quality text to communicate your message. If your grammar, spelling and expression are poor, the reader may be left confused and have the sense that you really aren’t writing thoughtfully and with authority on the subject.



<br>Always get a rule proof read and edited by a good English speaker who can assess whether or not your rule communicates its message and conforms to company standards, and who can find any errors in spelling, grammar and punctuation.
