When you have aÂ disagreement with someoneÂ who hasÂ decision making power, and youÂ areÂ unable to convince them that your recommendation is correctÂ (and they were unable to convince you that their decision is correct), you mustÂ send an email to the people involved including your thoughts, because:
 
1. Later down the track it will provide a learning experience for someone (depending on who was right ðŸ˜‰)
**Tip**: Use a <br>      [follow up thenâ€‹](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=aa8c8dd3-1cd7-414c-b13e-d1a225e05ef0) set for e.g. 6 months in the future to remind you to revisit your email, then take the opportunity to show off your foresight or eat humble pie (either way is a positive outcome, since it shows you were invested enough in the issue to keep track of it)
2. After cooling down from the meeting, people might read it later and see it as useful input

â€‹(6 months later)
"I knew it, we should never have used ReactÂ for the Northâ€‹wind project."â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹Bad example(On the day)
"Thanks for the chat today. For the record, I disagree withÂ doing theÂ Northwind Project in React and instead I recommend doing it in Angular, because...XXX.â€‹â€‹
That said, you are the Product Owner and have final say in the matter, so I will proceed with React as per your decision"â€‹â€‹
Good exampleÂ 
(6 months later, replying to the Product Owner's complaint about costs)
"As per our conversation, if you recall, I did mention about 6 months ago thatÂ we could have saved some money by using Angular instead of React (see email attached).Â We will be able to work around these issues, but unfortunately it will now cost more money than it would have if we used Angularâ€‹."
Good example â€“ you can refer back to your email to explain issues that may occur laterâ€‹

Tread carefully with a follow up email - use your discretion toÂ avoid souring a relationship by unnecessarily rubbing their face in it.â€‹

Start your email with the words "For the record,"Â so that you can find it more easily in the future.

â€‹This is also a good thing to do if you have an <br>      [ethical problem](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=abac8182-ec61-48d2-85de-6201be2cf1de)â€‹ with a task.
