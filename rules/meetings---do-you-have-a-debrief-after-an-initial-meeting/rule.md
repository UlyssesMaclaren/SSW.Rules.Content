<span class='intro'> <p>
            There is always something we can learn from our interactions with clients.<br>
            Initial meetings are a great opportunity to learn how we can fine tune our sales skills. Because there are always 2 SSW representatives in initial meetings with clients (usually an account manager and a developer) you should hold a debrief after the meeting on the way back to the office.</p> </span>

<p>Questions that you should ask each other are&#58;</p>
<ol>
<li>Did I do or say anything wrong?</li>
<li>Was I listening to the client or was I talking too much?</li>
<li>Did I give the client my full attention?</li>
<li>Is there anything I could have done better?</li>
<li>Do you think I connected with the client?</li>
<li>How can we improve our sales process from what we learned in this meeting?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>You should be as honest as possible with each other during the debrief but always use the <a href="/Management/Rules-to-Better-Software-Consultants-Working-in-a-Team/Pages/The-sandwich-rule.aspx" target="_blank">sandwich rule</a>.</p>
            Any good ideas or suggested changes should be emailed to the Product Owner.
