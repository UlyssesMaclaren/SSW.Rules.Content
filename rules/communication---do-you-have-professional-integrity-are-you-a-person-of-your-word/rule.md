​The word “integrity” can be loaded with ethical connotations, so let me define my meaning:
 
​Integrity is:

1. **Being true to your word**
    1. This means doing what you say you’d​ do, by the time you said you’d do it
2. **If you can’t deliver on your promise, have a plan for a path forward**
    1. If you can’t get the agreed task done by the deadline, tell the person why and set a new deadline, or agree on a different deliverable.
    2. Never leave them guessing
3. **If you break your word, acknowledge it, and work out a way to repair your integrity**
    1. ​Recognise the fault and propose a plan for how to do better next time


People who have integrity:

- Always take full ownership of any task given to them
- Inspire trust in co-workers and bosses
- Hold themselves to a high professional standard


Bosses with employees who have integrity:

- Trust their employees
- Are comfortable delegating more important work
