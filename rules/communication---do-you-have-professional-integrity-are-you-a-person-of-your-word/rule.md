​​​​​​​The word “integrity” can be loaded with ethical connotations, but in this context, integrity means:
 
1. ** Being true to your word**
    1. This means doing what you say you’ll do, by the time you say you’ll do it
2. **If you can’t deliver on your promise, have a plan for a path forward**
    1. If it looks like you won't be able to get the agreed task done by the deadline, tell the person why and set a new deadline, or agree on a different deliverable.
    2. Never leave them guessing
3. **If you break your word, acknowledge it, and work out a way to repair your integrity**
    1. If the deadline passes and you didn't do the above, recognize the fault and propose a plan for how to do better next time


Hi Keith, 

As per our conversation, I'm sorry I missed the full requirements for this PBI. 

Next time I will add the details of your requirements into the Acceptance Criteria of the PBI and pay more attention to them. 

Cheers, Lars​
