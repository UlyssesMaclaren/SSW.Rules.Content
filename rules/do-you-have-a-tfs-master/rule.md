The best way of getting the most out of TFS is to have a 'TFS master'. A 'TFS master' is like a Scrum Master but only interested in helping you get 100% from TFS:- Taking you beyond, TFS as a source control system
- Getting TFS to help you on a proper ALM road
- Make sure that Build are created and managed properly by the developers
- Manage the Build servers (builds themselves are the responsibility of the developers)
- Check the builds are fit for purpose, and that unit tests are included
- Deployment is fine and working properly
- Checking Wix files
- Checking the right check-in policies are enabled
- Code analysis is enabled and getting stronger
- Code auditor is running
- Checking the reports are looking healthy
- Clean up unused Workspaces (this removes old check outs by default)
- Make sure all patches are applied to the servers
- Send out check-in warnings every week to people which have left over check outs. (No task should take longer than 8 hours)
- etc...


These duties need to be taken care of on a regular basis.
