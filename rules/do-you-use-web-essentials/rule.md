​Web Essentials is a Visual Studio extension that greatly improves the productivity of web developers. More times than not, the features of Web Essentials make their way into Visual Studio itself. 
​You can install Web Essentials from the **Tools** | **Extensions and Updates **menu.

![](SSW - Rules - Web Essentials.png)​​Good Example: Web Essentials is in the Installed list.
Be sure to make sure your visual studio version and your web essentials version are the same.

You can find more information at the extensions website found here: [http://vswebesse​ntials.com/​​](http://vswebessentials.com/)
