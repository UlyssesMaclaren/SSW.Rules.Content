 If you don't have Camtasia or ScreenFlow, you can use the built-in QuickTime Player to record the screen on Mac OSX.
 
Open the QuickTime Player through the Applications folder, or by using search (Ctrl + Space) and typing QuickTime:
<dl class="image"><dt><img alt="QuickTime Player.png" src="/PublishingImages/QuickTime%20Player.png" style="width&#58;650px;"></dt><dd>&#160;Figure&#58; Search for QuickTime Player</dd></dl>
From QuickTime Player, you can start a new Screen Recording from the File menu:
<dl class="image"><dt><img alt="QuickTime new screen recording.png" src="/PublishingImages/QuickTime%20new%20screen%20recording.png"></dt><dd>Figure&#58; QuickTime Player New Screen Recording&#160;</dd></dl>
In the Screen Recording window, you an select which microphone to use if you want to record audio:
<dl class="image"><dt><img alt="QuickTime Recorder.png" src="/PublishingImages/QuickTime%20Recorder.png"></dt><dd>&#160;Figure&#58; Select your audio device</dd></dl>
** Tip:** Alternatively, you can use [Loom](https&#58;//www.useloom.com/) ![](/Style%20Library/SSW/CoreImages/external.gif "You are now leaving SSW"), which works as a Google Chrome extension.
