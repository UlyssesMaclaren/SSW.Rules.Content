 If you don't have Camtasia or ScreenFlow, you can use the built-in QuickTime Player to record the screen on Mac OSX. 
​Open the QuickTime Playey through the Applications folder, or by using search (Ctrl + Space) and typing QuickTime:
<dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img alt="QuickTime Player.png" src="/DesignandPresentation/RulesToBetterVideoRecording/SiteAssets/Pages/Do-you-know-how-to-record-th-screen-on-a-Mac/QuickTime%20Player.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;650px;"></dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal">&#160;Figure&#58; Search for QuickTime Player</dd>


From QuickTime Player, you can tart a new Screen Recording from the File menu:
<dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img alt="QuickTime new screen recording.png" src="/DesignandPresentation/RulesToBetterVideoRecording/SiteAssets/Pages/Do-you-know-how-to-record-th-screen-on-a-Mac/QuickTime%20new%20screen%20recording.png" style="margin&#58;5px;"></dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; QuickTime Player New Screen Recording&#160;</dd>
In the Screen Recording window, you an select which microphone to use if you want to record audio:
