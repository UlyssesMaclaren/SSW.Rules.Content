Line art graphics and anything with well defined shapes (logos, vector illustrations, e.t.c.) must be saved in SVG format.

Some of SVG format advantages are:

- Written in XML
- Text-based
- Official W3C graphics standard
- Accessible for people with visual disabilities
- Searchable
- Can be animated
- No pixelation
- Small file size
- Supports transparency
- Text can be selected, copied, spoken by the computer, and indexed by search engines.
