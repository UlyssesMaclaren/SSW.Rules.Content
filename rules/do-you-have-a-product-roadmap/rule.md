<span class='intro'> <p>A product backlog is a great way to see the fairly small broken up PBIs (Product Backlog Items) that make up your team's to do list but it can be a bit too zoomed in.</p> </span>

<p>​To&#160;get a better zoomed out look, you should have a product roadmap. This could be using TFS Features or Epics, or could known as&#160;MMFs (minimal marketable features), but the concept is the same... what is the order of the main feature groups that you will be working on?</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal"><img src="/PublishingImages/Features.jpg" alt="Features.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" />Figure&#58;&#160;​TFS PBIs organized​ by Features to see a long term Product&#160;Roadmap and high level priorities</dd>
