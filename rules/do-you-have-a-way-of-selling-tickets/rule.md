Managing the process of selling tickets can be very time consuming if you try and do it on your own. ​​
 
​A much better approach is to use a service like [EventBrite](http&#58;//www.eventbrite.com/). SSW uses EventBrite for all events, as it allows you to manage all aspects of ticketing

- Selling
- Refunding
- Marketing
- Mailing lists
- Issuing more tickets
- And much more​
