We DON'T charge clients when an SSW developer uses an SSW product as part of the                     toolkit he takes(e.g. we use Upsizing PRO when doing an upsizing job). This                     is because it's just like a plumber [using his wrench](/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/ToolBox.aspx). The developer takes it away with him when he leaves.
 
We DO charge clients when an SSW developer installs or provides an SSW product for                             the ongoing use of the client e.g. Code Auditor, Team Calendar or Extreme Emails,                             which the client's staff will use after SSW leaves. This is just like a plumber                             buying a particular piece of pipe to fix a sink.

SSW does not discount product prices to clients. This devalues the product.
