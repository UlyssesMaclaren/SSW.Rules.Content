Promises made by email are often pretty empty - the person who made the promise either has to make a note in a paper diary, stick a post-it note to his screen, or regularly trawl through Sent Items for all the off-hand promises made.

To ensure you follow up when you make a promise, you should do the following:

1. When you receive an email from a client requesting a response, CC yourself in the reply.
2. Move the email you have just sent yourself into a subfolder of your mailbox called 'Follow Ups'.
3. Add a follow up reminder to the email.
4. Check your follow up folder daily, and reply to any emails that are older than a week using the words 'Just touching base....'
5. Remove the email from your follow up folder when you have resolved the issue.
