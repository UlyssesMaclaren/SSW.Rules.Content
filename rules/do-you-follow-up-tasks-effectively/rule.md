Sometimes the person responsible for a task isn't able to complete it right away or anytime soon. In this case, a promise is made and the person either has to make a note in a paper diary, stick a post-it note to his screen, or regularly trawl through 'Sent Items' for all the off-hand promises made.

Another scenario is when the task should be done or will expire after a period of time. For example: "Send Google Analytics data after a month" or "Remove course banner after the course is completed".

To ensure you follow up any task like these, there are two ways to set yourself a task to follow up in the future:

### Delayed Email 


Write yourself an email in Outlook. 
Before pressing send, click **Options** | **Delay Delivery**, and then specify when you want to be reminded.

The email will sit in your outbox until the required time, when it will be sent to whoever you specified (you in this case)
When you receive it in your inbox, action the task.

### Email reminders - followupthen.com 


There is a brilliant service called FollowUpThen which can do all the administrative work for you.

Simply BCC or email Simply BCC or email **&lt;period of time&gt;@followupthen.com** and it will send you an email when that time expires, reminding you to follow up with another email.
