<span class='intro'> 
  <p>Promises made by email are often pretty empty - the person who made the promise either has to make a note in a paper diary, stick a post-it note to his screen, or regularly trawl through Sent Items for all the off-hand promises made. </p>
<p>To ensure you follow up when you make a promise, you should do the following&#58; </p>
 </span>


  <ol>
    <li>When you receive an email from a client requesting a response, CC yourself in the reply. </li>
    <li>Move the email you have just sent yourself into a subfolder of your mailbox called 'Follow Ups'. </li>
    <li>Add a follow up reminder to the email. </li>
    <li>Check your follow up folder daily, and reply to any emails that are older than a week using the words 'Just touching base....' </li>
    <li>Remove the email from your follow up folder when you have resolved the issue. </li>
</ol>
