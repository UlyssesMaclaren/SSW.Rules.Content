You can communicate better by using screenshots with balloons and other visual elements (arrows, shapes, and highlights) instead of only text. [Read the benefits of using screenshots here](/Pages/HowToUseBalloons.aspx).

We recommend you define a standard style for your visual elements by changing the default colours and shapes according to your branding.

To use SSW branding on your next screenshots, you should have the latest version of Snagit (which is the leading screen capture utility) and import the theme.
Find SSW Snagit theme here: [\\fileserver\DataSSW\DataSSWEmployees\Templates\SSW.snagtheme](file&#58;///fileserver/DataSSW/DataSSWEmployees/Templates/SSW.snagtheme).

Instructions to create and use Snagit themes can be found at [Quick Style Themes Tutorial](https&#58;//www.techsmith.com/tutorial-snagit-13-quick-style-themes.html?utm_source=product&amp;utm_medium=snagit&amp;utm_campaign=sw13).

### Go Beyond with Snagit Presets


We use a 1px grey border. Presets can't be defined on the theme. Everyone has to add them on their own Snagit tools:

1. Select border tool (you need to add it first by **[RMB on toolbar] | Customize | Effects | Border**)
2. Set up 1px grey border
3. Add it to Quick Effects
4. Click on your new quick effect once to add the 1px grey border (be sure to **Select All **before copying, because Snagit has got problems with the selecting there…you could miss the added border)


PS. You don’t have to do step 1, you can just add a border from **Effects | Border** or only add it to the quick effects and access via **Effects | Quick Effects**. For the sake of simplicity and ease of access, it’s easier to have this in the toolbar.

**Tip:** You can automatically have your SSW ​Snagit presets on sign-in via a script. See [https://github.com/SSWConsulting/LoginScript](https&#58;//github.com/SSWConsulting/LoginScript).
