You can communicate better by using screenshots with balloons and other visual elements (arrows, shapes, and highlights) instead of only text.     [Read the benefits of using screenshots here](/Pages/HowToUseBalloons.aspx).
We recommend you define a standard style for your visual elements by changing the default colors and shapes according to your branding.
