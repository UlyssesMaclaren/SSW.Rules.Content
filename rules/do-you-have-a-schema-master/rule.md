 You have a web site master right? This is the central point of contact if the site goes down.
<br>When developing an application, all members can code. However schema changes being done by many developers often can lead to trouble. 

<br>WhoÂ is "Schema Master"? What does he do?<br> ![](/Standards/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterSQLServerSchemaDeployment/PublishingImages/Nick.png) Figure: One person should be the 'Schema Master', on an average sized project (of 5-10 devs) 
If your project has a database, you need to select a "Schema Master". This is the one person who is allowed to make modifications to the database. These include:

- Creating, Modifying and Deleting tables and columns
- Relationships
- Modify [Controlled Lookup Data](/Standards/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterSQLServerSchemaDeployment/Pages/DoYouDeployLookupData.aspx)

 The "Schema Master" in a development shop is often the lead programmer on the team. He is in charge of all database changes and scripting them out and checking them into source control. ![](/Standards/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterSQLServerSchemaDeployment/PublishingImages/zsVersionTable.png) Figure: The Applications Database stores version info in a table called \_zsVersion ![](/Standards/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterSQLServerSchemaDeployment/PublishingImages/SQLScriptInTFS.png) Figure: Only a "Schema Master" checks in the .sql files
