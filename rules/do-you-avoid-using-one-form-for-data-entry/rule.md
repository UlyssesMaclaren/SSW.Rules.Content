<span class='intro'> <p>Combining data entry and find navigation is a mistake. I think 2 forms 
are better than one. I prefer a list box on one form with &quot;Add&quot;, &quot;Edit&quot; 
and &quot;Delete&quot; buttons to a popup form. Rather than a listbox and the data
 entry fields on one form.</p> </span>
