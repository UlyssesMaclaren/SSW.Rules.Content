 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 
I guess there could be special folders for bug reports that are sent by exception handlers, but I still would not be keen on this.

A better way is Conversation View and collapsing them if you need to hide them.
![Conversation View](/Standards/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/conversationview.JPG) Figure: Conversation View allows you to choose which folders to collapse.
