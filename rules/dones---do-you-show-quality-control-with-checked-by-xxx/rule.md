<span class='intro'> When you get your task done, you should carefully check each item in the email task and make sure it's qualified.&#160;For&#160;some of the task, you need someone to check it again for you before sending the &quot;DONE&quot;&#160;email.&#160;&#160;<br><br> </span>

Simply ask for that person to come over and check it on your computer or IM him/her if the person is not close by (e.g. in different room).This way you are guaranteed instant feedback and you won't clog up someone else's inbox with unnecessary emails. <br>Reply the &quot;DONE&quot; email like below and cc the person who check the email for you.
