 ​​When you get your task done, you should carefully check each item in the email task and make sure it's qualified. For some of the task, you need someone to check it again for you before sending the "DONE" email.  

   Simply ask for that person to come over and check it on your computer or IM him/her if the person is not close by (e.g. in different room).This way you are guaranteed instant feedback and you won't clog up someone else's inbox with unnecessary emails. 
Reply the "DONE" email like below and cc the person who checked the email for you. In this way, you show it was double checked.
