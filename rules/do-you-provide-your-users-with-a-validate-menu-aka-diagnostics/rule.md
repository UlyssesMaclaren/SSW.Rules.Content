We recommend adding these menus to your Tools Menu:

- Tools - Validate Schema (with [SSW SQL Deploy](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/SQLDeploy/Default.aspx))
- Tools - [Validate Data](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterInterfaces.aspx#ValidateData)
- Tools - [Run Unit Tests](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/rulestobetterwindowsforms.aspx#UnitTests) (with NUnit)
- Tools - View Application Errors (with SSW Exception Logger)
- Tools - Validate PC (with [SSW Diagnostics](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Diagnostics/Default.aspx))
