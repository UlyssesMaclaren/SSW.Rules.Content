If you want to know your website is working or not, you need to add a ping check to the machine also an HTTP Content Scan to the website in WhatsUp. We use WhatsUp to do real-time monitoring.
â€‹Follow these steps to check your website in WhatsUp: 
1. Add your website as a new device.  ![running1.GIF](running1.GIF) Figure: New device

3. Add an HTTP Content Scan monitor.  ![running3.GIF](running3.GIF) Figure: HTTP Content Scan
4. Edit the scan script. In the script, you can see 2 keywords "Send" and "Expect".
"Send" expression is an  HTTP request to your website.
"Expect" expression is a regular expression to check the key word in response from your website.
