This rule has been important for a long time: Fix bugs/issues before adding functionality/improvements.

- Bugs and issues get more expensive as they get older
- Bugs and issues become more complex the longer you wait to fix them
- You have better access to the developer or person who created it who will be able to solveÂ it faster




Failing to follow this rule encourages developers and creators to focus on new 'interesting' functionality and improvements which is exactly what you don't want...
You must be strong in the face of pressures from project plan scheduling!
