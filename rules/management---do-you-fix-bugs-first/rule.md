<span class='intro'> 
  <p>This rule has been important for a long time&#58; Fix bugs before adding functionality. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Bugs get more expensive as they get older </li>
    <li>Bugs become more complex the longer you wait to fix it </li>
    <li>You have better access to the developer who created it who will be able to fix it faster</li>
</ul>
 </span>


  <p>Failing to follow this rules encourages developers to focus on new 'interesting' functionality which is exactly what you don't want...</p>
<p>You must be strong in the face of pressures from project plan scheduling!</p>
