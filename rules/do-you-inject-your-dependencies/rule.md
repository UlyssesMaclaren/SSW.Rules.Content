Injecting your dependency gives you:

- Loosely coupled classes
- Increased code reusing
- Maintainable code
- Testable methods
- All dependencies are specified in one place
- Class dependencies are clearly visible in the constructor

 ![ Bad Example â€“ A solution where each layer depends on static classes is not maintainable or testable ![inject ](inject-bad-1.jpg)
