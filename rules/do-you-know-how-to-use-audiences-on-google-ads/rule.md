- **Affinity Audience** – Show your ads to unique audiences based on their lifestyles, buying habits, and long-term interests that you can pick.
- **Custom Affinity Audience** – Show your ads to specific audiences based on the affinity selections that you can choose to create a custom audience.
- **In-Market Audience** – Find customers who are researching and are actively looking into buying a service or product you sell.
- **Remarketing & Similar Audiences** – Show your ads to people who have visited your website previously before (You can choose the period) or viewed your content somewhere online. This would include remarketing lists.
