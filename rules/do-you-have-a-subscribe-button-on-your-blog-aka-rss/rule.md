The RSS or 'subscribe' button is a place on your blog that alow visitors to easily receive your blog's updates.  
Blogs that have a visible 'subscribe' button will certainly receive more returning visitors.

**Tip:** For Wordpress, there are plugins that make it easy to insert the 'subscribe' button in your WP blog. We recommend:
