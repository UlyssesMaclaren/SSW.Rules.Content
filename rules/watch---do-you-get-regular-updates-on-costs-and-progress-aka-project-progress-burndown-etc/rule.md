You're the one paying the bills, make sure you know where the costs are and how the project is progressing.

Insist on receiving these 3 reports each week:

- Project Progress ($ spent)
- Burndown (ETA)
- Story Overview (testing quality)


1. Current project costs (from the timesheets directly). This allows you to see the actual costs of the project on a weekly basis.<br>        ![project progress report](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/images/projectprogresscapture.JPG)
**Figure: Project Progress – There is $8K outstanding**
2. Current hours remaining and hours completed for the current sprint.<br>        ![Burndown report from TFS](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/images/burndown.JPG)

    **Questions that the Burndown and Burn Rate report help answer: **

    1. Is the team likely to finish the iteration on time?
    2. Will the team complete the required work, based on the current Burn Rate?
    3. Has the team added work to the iteration?
    4. How much work does each team member have?

    1. How much work does each story require?
    2. How much work has the team completed for each story?
    3. Are the tests for each story passing?
    4. How many active bugs does each story have?
