​While working in a team, there are three ways of seeing others' or team calendars.​
 
### Option 1: Using Outlook Calendar - See a person's calendar


You can share your Outlook calendar with another person or a group in Outlook. This option is useful when you want to share your personal calendar with others.

In the example below, Chris is going to share his personal calendar with the "SSWAll" group, so they can see what's he's doing from Outlook calendar.

Here's how to share your calendar (in this example, with a group):​
![outlook365 sharing using right click.png](/SiteAssets/calendar-do-you-know-the-ways-to-share-and-see-others-calendars/outlook365%20sharing%20using%20right%20click.png)Figure: In Outlook: 1. Right click on the calendar you want to share;​ 2. Click "Properties..."

#### If you are still using Outlook 2016 v1812 and older, or Outlook 365 below v1812

 Then the other person will receive a sharing notification email: 
![outlook365 sharing using right click - email.png](/SiteAssets/calendar-do-you-know-the-ways-to-share-and-see-others-calendars/outlook365%20sharing%20using%20right%20click%20-%20email.png)Figure: The invitees will receive a calendar sharing notification. Click "Open this Calendar" to open the calendar in Outlook

Here's how to open someone's calendar in ​Outlook (if they have shared it with you):

![outlook365 open-shared-calendar.png](/SiteAssets/calendar-do-you-know-the-ways-to-share-and-see-others-calendars/outlook365%20open-shared-calendar.png)Figure: In Outlook, click "Open Calendar" | "From Address Book..." (this opens the Global Address List)
![outlook365 open-shared-calendar - address book.png](/SiteAssets/calendar-do-you-know-the-ways-to-share-and-see-others-calendars/outlook365%20open-shared-calendar%20-%20address%20book.png)Figure: Find their name, ensure their name is on the list, and click OK



### Option 2: Using the CRM Service Calendar - See everyone's calendar


When you want to see what's your colleague's is doing, you can use the CRM Service Calendar.

​This can keep track of important things like client work and leave. See [Scheduling - Do you know how to book developers for a project?](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=d51b4fd0-dc73-4e51-a6fd-e2354b6add89) on how to add a booking to CRM Service Calendar.

**Note:** This will only show appointments that have been tracked in CRM.​

### Option 3: Using SharePoint's calendars - Share with a team


You can also create a calendar in SharePoint which will be shared with the team in that SharePoint site. By sharing a calendar using SharePoint, new developers who have just joined the team can immediately look at the project's events (e.g. Daily Scrum meeting).

In this scenario, the scrum master of "SSWSugarLearning" wants to share the calendar called "Team Calendar" with his team.

To share a team calendar, you just need to give the calendar URL to the a person in your team.



**Tip: **You can also connect the SharePoint calendar to your Outlook. Here's how to do that:​

Click on "Calendar" tab; Step 2. Click "Connect to Outlook" to show the calendar on your Outlook account (SharePoint 2016)

#### If you are still using SharePoint 2007

**Note:** The disadvantage of the SharePoint calendar is every new employee that arrives (or those that leave), must share (or unshared) their calendars in their Outlook client.
