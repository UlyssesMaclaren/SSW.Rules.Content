​​​​​​​​There are 3 ways of sharing and seeing others' calendars.​
 
### Option 1: Sharing Outlook Personal Calendar


We can share our Outlook calendar with another person or a group on Outlook.

In the example below, we will share our "SSW SugarLearning" calendar with "SSWAll" group. After doing this step, the other person should be able to see our SugarLearning Daily Scrum events in their Outlook calendar.

How to share the calendar:

#### If you are still using Outlook 2016 v1812 and older, or Outlook 365 below v1812

 Then the other person just needs to accept the sharing request and show it in their Outlook. Here's how to see a shared calendar on Outlook:

SSW SugarLearning calendar events will show up in here (Outlook 365)

### Option 2: Using the CRM Service Calendar


When you want to keep track of important things like leave or client work, you can share your schedule via CRM Service Calendar.

**Note:** This will only show appointments that have been tracked in CRM.​

### Option 3: Using SharePoint's calendars


In this scenario, we want to share an event called "Some Event" with another person. There are two ways of doing this:

1. By sharing the calendar link - only works if the other person has access to your calendar.
2. By sharing the calendar via Outlook.

Click on "Calendar" tab; 2. Click "Email a Link" to share this calendar's URL (SharePoint 2016)​​

Click on "Calendar" tab; 2. Click "Connect to Outlook" to show the calendar on your Outlook account (SharePoint 2016). Note: See "Option 1" on how to share a calendar on Outlook

#### If you are still using SharePoint 2007

**Note:** The disadvantage of the SharePoint calendar is every new employee that arrives (or those that leave), must share (or unshared) their calendars in their Outlook client.
