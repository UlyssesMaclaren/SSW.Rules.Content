While working in a team, there are three ways of sharing and seeing others' or team calendars.​
 
### Option 1: Using Outlook Calendar - Share with a person or a group


You can share your Outlook calendar with another person or a group on Outlook. This option is useful when you want to share your personal calendar with another person or with a group.

In the example below, Chris is going to share his personal calendar with "SSWAll" group. After doing this step, the other person in "SSWAll" group should be able to see his events in their Outlook calendar.

Here's how to share your calendar with a group / a person:​​

#### If you are still using Outlook 2016 v1812 and older, or Outlook 365 below v1812

 Then the other person will receive a sharing notification email:
![outlook365 sharing using right click - email.png](/SiteAssets/calendar-do-you-know-the-ways-to-share-and-see-others-calendars/outlook365%20sharing%20using%20right%20click%20-%20email.png)Figure: The invitees will receive a calendar sharing notification. Click "Open this Calendar" to open the calendar in your Outlook
You can also open your colleague's calendar from Outlook by yourself. However, you can only see their calendar if they have shared it with you.




Here's how to open someone's calendar on the Outlook:

![outlook365 open-shared-calendar.png](/SiteAssets/calendar-do-you-know-the-ways-to-share-and-see-others-calendars/outlook365%20open-shared-calendar.png)Figure: Click "Open Calendar" calendar and click "From Address Book..." to open your company's global address book

Double-click their name; Step 3. Ensure their name is on the list and click OK



### Option 2: Using the CRM Service Calendar - Share with everyone


When you want to share your calendar with everyone or look at your colleague's booking status, you can use the CRM Service Calendar.

The CRM Service Calendar is used to keep track of important things like leave or client work via CRM Service Calendar. See [Scheduling - Do you know how to book developers for a project?](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=d51b4fd0-dc73-4e51-a6fd-e2354b6add89) on how to add a booking to CRM Service Calendar.

**Note:** This will only show appointments that have been tracked in CRM.​

### Option 3: Using SharePoint's calendars - Share with a team


You can also create a calendar on SharePoint which will be shared with the team in that SharePoint site. By sharing a calendar using SharePoint, new developers who have just joined the team can immediately look at the project's events (e.g. Daily Scrum meeting).

In this scenario, the project manager of "SSWSugarLearning" want to share the project calendar called "Team Calendar" containing SugarLearning Scrum events with his team.

There are two ways of doing this:

1. By sharing the calendar link - the other person must have the access to the SharePoint calendar. **(****Recommended****)**
2. By sharing the calendar via Outlook. (See "Option 1" above on how to share a calendar on Outlook)

Click on "Calendar" tab; Step 2. Click "Email a Link" to share this calendar's URL (SharePoint 2016)​​

Click on "Calendar" tab; Step 2. Click "Connect to Outlook" to show the calendar on your Outlook account (SharePoint 2016)

#### If you are still using SharePoint 2007

**Note:** The disadvantage of the SharePoint calendar is every new employee that arrives (or those that leave), must share (or unshared) their calendars in their Outlook client.
