While working in a team, there are three ways of sharing and seeing others' or team calendars.​
 
### Option 1: Using Outlook Calendar


We can share our Outlook calendar with another person or a group on Outlook.

In the example below, I am going to share my personal calendar with "SSWAll" group. After doing this step, the other person in "SSWAll" group should be able to see my events in their Outlook calendar.

By doing this step, the other person can see my calendar in their Outlook.

These are the steps to share my calendar with another person / team:

#### If you are still using Outlook 2016 v1812 and older, or Outlook 365 below v1812

 Then the other person will receive a sharing notification email:

Click "Open this Calendar" to open the calendar in your Outlook
You can also open your colleague's calendar from Outlook by yourself. However, you can only see their calendar if they have shared it with you.




Here's how to see the someone's calendar on Outlook:

![outlook365 open-shared-calendar.png](/SiteAssets/calendar-do-you-know-the-ways-to-share-and-see-others-calendars/outlook365%20open-shared-calendar.png)Figure: Click "Open Calendar" calendar and click "From Address Book..." to open your company's global address book.

Double-click their name; Step 3. Ensure their name is on the list and click OK



### Option 2: Using the CRM Service Calendar


When you want to share your calendar with everyone or look at your colleague's booking status, you can use the CRM Service Calendar.

The CRM Service Calendar is used to keep track of important things like leave or client work via CRM Service Calendar. See [Scheduling - Do you know how to book developers for a project?](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=d51b4fd0-dc73-4e51-a6fd-e2354b6add89) on how to add bookings to CRM Service Calendar.

**Note:** This will only show appointments that have been tracked in CRM.​

### Option 3: Using SharePoint's calendars


We can also create a calendar on SharePoint which will be shared with our team.

In this scenario, we want to share our calendar called "Team Calendar" containing SugarLearning Scrum events with our team. There are two ways of doing this:

1. By sharing the calendar link - only works if the other person has access to your calendar. **(****Recommended****)**
2. By sharing the calendar via Outlook.

Click on "Calendar" tab; Step 2. Click "Email a Link" to share this calendar's URL (SharePoint 2016)​​

Click on "Calendar" tab; Step 2. Click "Connect to Outlook" to show the calendar on your Outlook account (SharePoint 2016). Note: See "Option 1" on how to share a calendar on Outlook

#### If you are still using SharePoint 2007

**Note:** The disadvantage of the SharePoint calendar is every new employee that arrives (or those that leave), must share (or unshared) their calendars in their Outlook client.
