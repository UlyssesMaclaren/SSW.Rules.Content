 Projects will change and deviate from the original scope – that is a given in software development. Having the ability to understand the impact of slotting in a new request into the sprint is gold because you can tell management that "If we do X now that means we can’t do Y and Z in this sprint and it will push back the release by another sprint" with the data to back that up. Project Server 2010 gives you that ability with the "Tracking Gantt" ![Project Server 2010 Tracking Gantt tells us the deviations from the baseline estimates](/Management/RulesToBetterProjectManagement/PublishingImages/gantt-chart.jpg)Figure: Project Server 2010 Tracking Gantt tells us the deviations from the baseline estimates
