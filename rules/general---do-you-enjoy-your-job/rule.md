The expectation is:

- First is to put your heart into your job and enjoy yourself
- Get your responsibilities done
- Improve your company to become a better place every week
- Improve yourself to become a better person every week

 
If you find yourself not enjoying your job this is not necessarily a bad thing.                     You should make a commitment to give it a go and try to make it work. When you have                     decided you are unhappy you should talk to your boss and figure out what is making                     you unhappy. The fact is that there are some jobs that you are not suited to. It                     is probably best for everyone that you start to think about moving on and trying                     something that may make you happier.

The number 1 cause of stress in this industry is caused by impending budgets. The                     best way to handle this is to give realistic estimates, and imform the clients as                     soon as it looks like they will be exceeded. A client who has accepted the realities                     of his project is less scary than working on code that's already over-budget with                     an impending unknown client reaction.
