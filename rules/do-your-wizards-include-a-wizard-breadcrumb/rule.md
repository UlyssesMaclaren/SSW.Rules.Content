Headings that direct the user around your web page are       important as it gives the user the feeling of confident in       using your web page. The user will tend to feel lost and       unsure in what he/she should be doing next, if a website       dose not directs them properly. Good navigation through       directing headings removes this feeling and gives the user       confidence. This rule becomes especially important when it       comes to shopping applications. Showing the user where they       are up to in buying products, previous steps and the next       step in the process, gives the user the confidence that they       are doing the right steps in purchasing a product. Allowing       the user to go back to previous steps allows them to change       or review a previous choice. Showing the user where they are       up to and what is next shows the user what is left in the       process in purchasing a product. Amazon is a very good       example of a good shopping Application.
