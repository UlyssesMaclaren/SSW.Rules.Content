If you have “custom site template” for  your site, you can’t upgrade your site to the SharePoint 2013 UI unless you have a site template with the same name ready for new UI.


![SharePoint will show you an error “Missing Site Templates” that prevents you from upgrading](missingSiteTemplateError.jpg)
 
To fix this issue

1. Upgrade your site template’s **content **files and **definition **XML file to SharePoint 2013 (refer to SharePoint 2013 default site template for details).
2. Package the site template’s **content **files to map location “**{SharePointRoot}\Template\SiteTemplate**”.
