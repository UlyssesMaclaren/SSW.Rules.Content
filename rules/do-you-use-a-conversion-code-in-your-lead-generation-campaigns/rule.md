<p>A conversion is an action you want the user to make while visiting your website. This could be filling in a form, watching a video or indeed making a purchase. To track if users are doing the action you want them to do, you should use a conversion code. This is a code (unique for every campaign you will do) that will check if every single user has performed the action directly on your website or via another one.</p><p>You may have heard about a tracking pixel too. <a href="https&#58;//support.clickmeter.com/hc/en-us/articles/211034566-What-is-the-difference-between-a-Tracking-Pixel-and-Conversion-Code-">ClickMeter explains the difference well&#58;</a></p><p></p><ul><li>The <strong>Tracking Pixel</strong> (not to be confused with Conversion Pixel) is an image of one pixel that you place in a webpage or in an email and let you track how many times the webpage has been viewed or the email opened&#58; http&#58;//support.clickmeter.com/entries/28182193-How-to-create-a-new-tracking-pixel-video-<br>If you need help setting this up, check <a href="https&#58;//blog.hotmart.com/en/conversion-pixel/">hotmat's blog</a> (although they mix the name).<br></li></ul><ul><li>The <strong>Conversion code</strong> is a piece (snippet) of code you place in the thank you page to track conversions.
