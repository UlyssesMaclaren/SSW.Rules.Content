<span class='intro'> ​​Adding texts to your videos can be very helpful to fix information in viewers minds. You must make sure the text is on the screen&#160;enough time for all readers to read it until the end. You don't want comments like &quot;Leave more time for text, almost all of them I didn’t have time to read&quot;. But how long? &#160;<br> </span>

<p>As a starting point, a&#160;safe way to measure is to&#160;leave it on screen long enough to be&#160;read between 2 and 3 times.&#160;</p><p>Depending on the complexity of the text this can be excessive or too fast.</p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/text-on-screen.png" alt="text-on-screen.png" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Considering it takes around 7 seconds to read the text on this screen, it should stay for around 15-20 seconds<br></dd></dl><p>PS. Of course, this rule if&#160;not valid for credits.</p>
