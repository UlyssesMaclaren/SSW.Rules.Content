<span class='intro'> A task should never have an estimate of more than a day (8 hours).
 </span>


  <p>If you have a big task with an estimate of more the 4 hours, you should consider breaking it in sub-tasks. In case the estimate has changed during the sprint, the “Remaining Hours” field must be update in order to have an accurate Burndown chart.</p>
<p>The reason scrum limits the maximum hours is because you should always know in which task you are working and we don’t believe one single action can take that long.</p>
