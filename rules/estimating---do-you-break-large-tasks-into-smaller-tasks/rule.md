<span class='intro'> This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). </span>


  <p style="margin&#58;0cm 0cm 0pt;vertical-align&#58;top;">
    <span style="color&#58;black;font-size&#58;13.5pt;">If you have a big task, which takes more the 4 hours, you might consider breaking it in sub-tasks. In case the estimate has changed during the sprint, the “Remaining Hours” field must be update in order to have an accurate Burndown chart.</span>

<p style="margin&#58;0cm 0cm 0pt;vertical-align&#58;top;"><span style="color&#58;black;font-size&#58;13.5pt;">The reason scrum limits the maximum hours is because you should always know in which task you are working and we don’t believe one single action can take that long.</span></p>
