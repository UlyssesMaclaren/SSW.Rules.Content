<span class='intro'> <p>Look at your boss's calendar, if you see a meeting at, say, 3pm, call him at, say, 12 noon and say something like &quot;Do you have anything going on this afternoon?&quot;</p>
                
             </span>

<p>If he knows he has a meeting at 3pm say &quot;How many hours away is that?&quot;, &quot;How long will it take you to get there?&quot;</p>â€‹
