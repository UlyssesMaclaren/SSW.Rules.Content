Whenever writing numbers for a web<br>audience, it's generally a good idea to use numerals, especially for<br>complicated numbers. Numerals are more easily noticed when a page is scanned by<br>a user's eye.
For example: 
â€‹There are seventy three good reasons to do this.
Figure: Bad Example - The number is spelled out.
There are 73 good reasons to do this.

Figure: Good Example - This is easy to read and more noticeable


The exception is generally very small numbers (one and two) which are normally spelled out.

2 heads are better than 1.
Figure: Bad Example - Numerals used
Two heads are better than one
Figure: Good Example - Numbers are spelled out
