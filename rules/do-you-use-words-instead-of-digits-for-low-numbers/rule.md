Whenever writing numbers for a web<br>audience, it's generally a good idea to use numerals, especially for<br>complicated numbers. Numerals are more easily noticed when a page is scanned by<br>a user's eye.
For example: 
[[badExample | The number is spelled out.]]
|  There are seventy three good reasons to do this.
[[goodExample | This is easy to read and more noticeable]]
|  There are 73 good reasons to do this.


The exception is generally very small numbers (one and two) which are normally spelled out.

[[badExample | Numerals used]]
|  2 heads are better than 1.
[[goodExample | Numbers are spelled out]]
|  Two heads are better than one
