<span class='intro'> Every rule must have a person responsible for its content - The rule owner. The way readers see this person is on the &quot;Acknowledgement&quot; section. </span>

<p>​When editing a rule, choose who is the rule owner on the &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; field. It is OK to have more than one person there.</p><dl class="image"><dt>
