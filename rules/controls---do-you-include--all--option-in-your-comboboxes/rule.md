ComboBoxes often used for filtering data. It is best to have an '-All-' option to give your user chances to select all data.

It is important to understand the idea of **visual text**. In a list you could see either:

- -None- or
- No activity assigned


Same meaning, but for the first one we see it, instead of reading it.
