By giving examples you are demonstrating clearly to the reader how he/she can to implement the rule correctly. It is better to position an example of the best possible scenario last so that the reader is left with a clear example in his/her mind as to what is required.

See [Do you show examples, a "bad example", then a "good example"?](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterTechnicalDocumentation.aspx#BadEgThenGoodEg) for more information.
