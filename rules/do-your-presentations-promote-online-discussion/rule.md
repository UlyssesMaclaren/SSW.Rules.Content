Getting attendees at a course or presentation involved has many benefits:

- They can share ideas with the presenter and each other
- They can provide feedback for improvement of the material
- They can share key points that they learn


The easiest way to get attendees involved is to promote a social media hashtag at the beginning of every presentation or course.
