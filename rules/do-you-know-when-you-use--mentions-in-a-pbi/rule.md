​​​So when the Product Owner verbally requests a change to a PBI how do you update the PBI to reflect the change and also keep track of the conversation?
 
You could send yourself a "​[To Myself](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=5c16d531-007d-49ef-8acc-b26596e13e84)" email and update the PBI description accordingly, but only those people included in the email chain are aware of the conversation.

Instead, what you should do is use the discussions feature in the PBI and mention the user using "@". 
The benefits of using comments are:

- Quick and easy, no need to compose email
- History is visible to anyone looking at the PBI (with email, if you don’t cc them, they wouldn’t have a clue)
- Easy to see all important notes/comments in one place instead of digging through email
