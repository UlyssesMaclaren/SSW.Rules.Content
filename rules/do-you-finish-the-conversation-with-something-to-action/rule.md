Having a nice chat with clients is great but you should always finish the conversation with something to action. For example, if they wanted their requirements changed you should send them a confirmation email if they wanted to schedule a meeting you should send them an Outlook appointment. Here are some more examples of typical things you action after a call:
 
- Add contact details to the company database
- Pass the call to someone else
- Start work
- Remind yourself to follow up with another phone call​
