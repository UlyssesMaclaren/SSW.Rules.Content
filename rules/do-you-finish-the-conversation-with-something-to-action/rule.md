<span class='intro'> <p>Having a nice chat with clients is great but you should always finish the conversation with something to action. For example, if they wanted their requirements changed you should send them a confirmation email if they wanted to schedule a meeting you should send them an Outlook appointment. Here are some more examples of typical things you action after a call&#58;<br></p> </span>

<ul><li>Add contact details to&#160;the company&#160;database</li><li>Pass the call to someone else</li><li>Start work</li><li>Remind yourself to follow up with another phone callâ€‹<br></li></ul>
