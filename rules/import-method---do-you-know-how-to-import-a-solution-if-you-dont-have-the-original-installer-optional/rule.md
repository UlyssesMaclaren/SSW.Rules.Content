 You should have at this point, either:

<br>1. Installer packages from 3rd Party Vendors for installing their custom solution or,
<br>2. WSP packages from 3rd party, or built from your own source code, or extracted using the Export Method (not recommended)

<br>You can add the WSP package solutions to the new server by:<br>
1. Open up **cmd** with Administrator privileges
2. Enter your **C:\SharePointCustomizations** folder
cd C:\SharePointCustomizations
3. Use **stsadm** to import the solution to your new server
Stsadm –o AddSolution –filename NameOfSolution.wsp
4. Make sure there are no errors when the command runs
