If you are providing food and drinks for the attendees, this needs to be booked in and confirmed.
 
Use the following checklist to ensure you get catering right.

- Dietary requirements – Are there any specific requirements​, such as vegetarian, gluten free, kosher, halal etc.?
- Is there adequate access to get the food and catering staff into the venue?
- Is there a designated area where food is served?
- Is the venue allowed to provide food for attendees?​


**TIP: **You can make your event look a million dollars by taking a little extra time and decanting your yummy offerings into nicer containers. ​
