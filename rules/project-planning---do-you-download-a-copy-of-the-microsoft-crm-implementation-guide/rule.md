The [Microsoft CRM Implementation Guide](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3621) contains essential information on installation pre-requisites and planning, implementation tools and troubleshooting.

Using the CHM (Compiled HTML Help) makes searching easier than using a word or pdf document.
