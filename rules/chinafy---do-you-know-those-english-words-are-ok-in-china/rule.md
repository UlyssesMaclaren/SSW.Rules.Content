If you are localizing your application to China, some of the English words are commonly used in China. Instead of translating a word to Chinese bluntly, you should keep them in English.
 
Here is a list of English words which are OK to use on your user interface:

- OK
- APP
- FAQ
- VS
- V1, V2 (Version 1, Version2)
- ID
- VR
- AI
- 3D
