<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">If your audio, camera or your microphone are not​ working properly, it’s very likely that you will have your communication affected on a call.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">We recommend that you do a test on the platform you are using for your meeting (Microsoft Teams, Skype for Business, etc) and follow their procedure to test your microphone and your audio.<br></p> </span>

<p>​A second option is to call a work colleague and ask them if they can hear and see you well. Good tips are to use headphones and to keep your microphone on mute when not speaking.&#160;​</p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/test-call.png" alt="test-call.png" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Call a work colleague to test your presentation on online calls and make sure it works!</dd>
