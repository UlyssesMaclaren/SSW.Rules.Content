<span class='intro'> When selecting their tasks, team members should be looking to extend their skills. Scrum encourages multi-skilled workers, rather than having testers, back-end developers, designers etc. In other words, all team members should be able to help completing any task.
 </span>


  <p>This does not imply that everyone is a guru in everything; no doubt some people are especially skilled in a specific area, but team members work together and should be learning new skills from each other.</p>
<p>During task generation and estimation in Sprint Planning, choose something new and ask someone experienced in that area to have a subtask to help you.&#160;</p>
<p>This is to make the team multi-skilled and reduce dependencies on individual. </p>
