Windows Integrated Authentication is the preferred option for use with intranet applications. When using Windows Integrated security, you don't need to implement the sign in system and user accounts database. The biggest advantage is if the user is already logged in to your domain they don't need to sing in to your application, it automatically logs them in instead of them having to sign in manually.
