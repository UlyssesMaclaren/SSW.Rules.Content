​
'That' is occasionally an unnecessary addition to a sentence, especially if it's a title that would benefit from being short and punchy. As such, avoid using "that" in a title wherever possible.

"Building Software that People Understand"
Figure: Bad Example - unnecessary "that"
"Building Software People Understand"

Figure: Good Example - without the "that", the setence is concise and has more punch​
