TFS 2012 includes 3 built-in process templates:

Instead of<br>start from sketch, you should always choose one of these built-in template to<br>do your own customization. It will depend on the target process for you to choose which one, for small and simple process, Scrum and Agile templates are recommended; for formal and complex process, choose the CMMI template.​

   ​Using an existing process template will save you a lot of time because

- It has the structure setup already, all you need to do is to make modifications and upload the template back to the server again.
- All the built-in reports could be used as template for your customization, this will save you a lot of time from creating a new report​.
