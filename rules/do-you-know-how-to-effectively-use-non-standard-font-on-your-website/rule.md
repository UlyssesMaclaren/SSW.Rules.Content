In some cases you may need to display text content on your page with a specific                     font. Unfortunately web browsers don't provide an easy way to deliver rich typography                     without sacrificing some functionality. Common approaches include:

1. Display the text as an image
2. sIFR
3. Font stacking​
4. Google Fonts​​​
5. Self-hosting​
6. Webfont services


​​Each method mentioned above has their disadvantages. We discourage #1 - Images are bad for Google juice and cannot be selected;​ and #2 - sFIR uses old technology based on nearly dead Flash.

For more information on the differences between the other methods read: The best way to serve fonts to your website.
