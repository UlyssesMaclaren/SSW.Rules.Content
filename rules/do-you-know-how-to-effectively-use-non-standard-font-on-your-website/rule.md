In some cases you may need to display text content on your page with a specific                     font. Unfortunately web browsers don't provide an easy way to deliver rich typography                     without sacrificing some functionality. Common approaches include:

1. Display the text as an image
2. sIFR
3. Font stacking​
4. Google Fonts​​​
5. Self-hosting​
6. Webfont services


​​Each method mentioned above has their disadvantages. We discourage #1 and #2 - Images are bad for Google juice and cannot be selected;​ sFIR uses old technology based on nearly dead Flash.

For more information on the other methods read: [The best way to serve fonts to your website](http&#58;//www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/03/the-best-way-to-serve-fonts-to-your-website/%E2%80%8B).
