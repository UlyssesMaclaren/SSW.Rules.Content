Users should be able to navigate around your application without having to return to the main menu to open a related form.

Think about a summary report - users should always be able to "drill-down" to track a transaction to its original source.
                    Think about a data entry form - users should always be able to "drill-down" to the look up table
 
There are four ways to provide drill-downs:

1. Preferred - Use buttons to navigate around the application <br>      ![SSW Timesheets - Add Timesheet Entry](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/DrillDownDrillAround.gif)Figure: Use named buttons to navigate around the application (Preferred)
2. Double click the control
3. Use buttons with three dots - an ellipsis (...) character <br>      ![SSW Code Auditor - Path to Scan](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/CodeAuditorEllipses.gif)Figure: Good Example - Use ellipses to navigate around the application
4. Use hyperlinks <br>      ![Asset Form](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/AssetForm.png)Figure: Drill-downs implemented as links (an interesting alternative but a bit too much of a visual impact)


Another handy thing to add for users is "drill-around". This is implemented by using a right mouse-click to activate context-sensitive links between related screens.
