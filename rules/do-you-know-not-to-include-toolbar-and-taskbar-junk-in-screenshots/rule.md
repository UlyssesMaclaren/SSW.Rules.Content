Screenshots are a very important part of websites these days. Be careful to avoid unnecessary toolbars and taskbars in screen shots.

Tips:

1. Use a region screen shot if appropriate (however the URL is generally helpful in most browser screen shots)
2. Go full screen e.g.â€‹ F11 in Internet Explorer, then +
3. Always have the 'Auto-hide the taskbar' option checked
