 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 
If the client is unhappy or upset, it's more important to show empathy and demonstrate that you understand your client's point of view, as it is more likely to win you future work.

Make sure you start a reply to an angry client with something like "I understand your frustration, and I think I can stop this happening again".

At this point in time, you want to aim for a compromise, where each party meets the other somewhere in the middle.
