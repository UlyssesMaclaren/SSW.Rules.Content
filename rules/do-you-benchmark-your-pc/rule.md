 ​​​It is important to benchmark your PC so that when making a major change to your PC you can be assured that it has been an improvement. 
There are a lot of great tools that can test the speed of your hardware, but these won't tell you if, for example, upgrading to the latest version of Windows has sped up or slowed down your computer.

[PassMark](http&#58;//www.passmark.com/)​however will give you a holistic view of how fast your computer can run specific software
