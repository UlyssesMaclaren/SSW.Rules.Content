<span class='intro'> We are always disappointed when adding version information to a Word document. When you use the Work version you get a number that indicates the number of times the document has been saved and not a proper version number.
<div><br>
It is possible to get the number into Word for the version of the document on the SharePoint document library.
</div>
 </span>

  <strong>Follow the guide here</strong>&#58; <a href="http&#58;//www.bryansgeekspeak.com/2009/03/moss-2007-show-sharepoint-version.html" target="_blank">http&#58;//www.bryansgeekspeak.com/2009/03/moss-2007-show-sharepoint-version.html</a><br>

<div><strong>Note&#58;</strong> This also works in SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010. <img alt="" class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" src="/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterSharePoint/PublishingImages/VersionInWord.jpg" /><font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood" size="+0">Figure&#58; Good example, you see the formatted SharePoint version number.<br>
