Group box should only be used when you want to notify the user the controls within it are really related, such as radio buttons.
   
[[badExample]]
| ![Inappropriate use of 'Group Box', there is nothing to be grouped](../../assets/RulesT8.jpg)
[[goodExample]]
| ![Use a line to organize different sections](../../assets/RulesT4.jpg)
[[goodExample]]
| ![VS.NET 2003 Options form, appropriate use of 'Group Box', the radio buttons are related to each other](../../assets/RulesT6.gif)
![ Good Example - VS.NET 2012 Options form, also appropriate use of 'Group Box'](../../assets/vsnet-groupbox.jpg)
In other cases, you should avoid using group box and replace it with a simple line, this will save you some space on the form and help you organize your form more easily.
