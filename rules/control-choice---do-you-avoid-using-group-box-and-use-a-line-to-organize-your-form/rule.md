Group box should only be used when you want to notify the user the controls within it are really related, such as radio buttons.
 ![ Bad Example - Inappropriate use of 'Group Box', there is nothing to be grouped![SSW Exchange Reporter Setup - Line for Grouping](../../assets/RulesT4.jpg)](../../assets/RulesT8.jpg)
In other cases, you should avoid using group box and replace it with a simple line, this will save you some space on the form and help you organize your form more easily.
