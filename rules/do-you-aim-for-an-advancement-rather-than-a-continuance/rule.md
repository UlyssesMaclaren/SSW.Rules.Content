                 </span>

<p>In business, everyone is busy. The prospect you met with has a million things to do, and they may be relying on a decision from someone who also has a million things on their plate. It's easy to get stuck in a 'continuance cycle'. A continuance is basically a stalling tactic.​</p>
                <p>A prospect will tell you that they're still interested, bu​t they haven't gotten around to making a decision for one reason or another. An advancement is a step that takes you closer to closing the sale. You should always aim for an advancement rather than a continuance. An advancement might be an agreement to complete mock-ups for the application. Often, small financial commitments will lead to bigger ones.</p><p>​​A great example of this practice is having a <a href="/Management/RulesToSuccessfulSalesAndAccountManagement/Pages/Ensure-an-excellent-1st-date.aspx">specification review </a>being​ a stepping stone towards the full sale.<br></p>
