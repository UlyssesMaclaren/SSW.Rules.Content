The user's last settings should be saved and should be selected as the Default the                     next time a form is opened in many instances. For example:
 
- Login forms - the last login name should be the Default selected and the cursor should be in the password box. <br>

[[goodExample]]
| ![Last Username is saved](../../assets/GoodFormLogin.jpg)
- Report criteria forms - e.g. date start and date end fields should be automatically populated


How do I store the settings?

- .NET: Use the <br>      [Configuration Block](/do-you-use-configuration-management-application-block) to store the settings.
- Access: Use a local table called 'Control' with one record.
