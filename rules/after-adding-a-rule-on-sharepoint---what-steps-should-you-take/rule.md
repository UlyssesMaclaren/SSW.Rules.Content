To prevent spelling or grammatical errors in the text content of a rule, you should complete the following steps:

- Check the rule in Office Word for [spelling or grammatical errors](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterWebsitesLayout.aspx#WordSpellingAndGrammarChecker)
- Run Link Auditor on that page
- Check the report and fix the errors
- Check in the page and repeat steps 2-3 until Link Auditor has all green ticks

<br>We also have a rule: [Adding a rule in aspx](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterWebsitesDevelopment.aspx#StepsAfterAddRuleOnAspxPage)
