In order to keep the rule you add is healthy and doesn't has any grammar or spelling mistake, you should follow the below steps once you finish adding a rule on SharePoint:

1. Check the rule in MS Word to see [if it has spelling or grammar mistakes](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterWebsitesLayout.aspx#WordSpellingAndGrammarChecker)
2. Run Link Auditor on that page
3. Check the report and fix the error
4. Check in the page and repeat step 2 and 3  until Link Auditor get all green ticks
