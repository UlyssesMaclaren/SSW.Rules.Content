Make sure your event is well signposted, so your attendees can find not only the venue, but also important areas within it.
 
â€‹Your signage could include the following

- Directions from nearby transport, such as train stations and bus stops
- Registration area
- The agenda for the day to inform attendees of what is next
- Nearest toilets
- Room numbers (if the venue doesn't have that already)
