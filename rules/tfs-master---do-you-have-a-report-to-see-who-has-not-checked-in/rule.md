 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). ![Source Safe VS.NET](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/SideKicksStatus.jpg)Figure: Use TFS Sidekicks and search for files older than 48 hours to find the naughty boys. Suggestion for TFS Sidekicks: Add a button to “Email all people their shame list”…. showing their files that are still checked out (until then I do it manually)
