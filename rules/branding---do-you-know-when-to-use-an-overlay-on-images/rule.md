Sometimes the photo you want to share is not ideal to include texts and/or your logo. Adding overlays on these images creates a professional look to any photo, helps to hide messy desks or floors if needed, and it gives it a consistent contrast and feel to the post. 



Itâ€™s a good way of adding text to a photo as well following your branding guidelines at the same time.

 
See some bad and good examples from SSW's social media below:

[[goodExample]]
| ![Overlay on a social media post used to have some text on it](goode5videos.png)
