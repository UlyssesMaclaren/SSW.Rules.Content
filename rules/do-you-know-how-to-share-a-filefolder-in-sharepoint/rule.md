<span class='intro'> You often need to share a linkt to a file or folder in SharePoint. ​ </span>

<p>Instead of copying it from the browser, you can open the menu on ellipsis link and get it from there&#58;</p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/sharepoint-link.jpg" alt="sharepoint-link.jpg" style="width&#58;650px;margin&#58;5px;" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Getting URL&#160;from SharePoint ellipsis menu.</dd></dl><p>Or even better, like any link on the web, you can right click and copy it from the browser prompt&#58;</p><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/browser-link.jpg" alt="browser-link.jpg" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Getting URL from right click. The only disadvantage is that you can't see the link before paste​</dd></dl>
