 You often need to share links to a file or folder in SharePoint. ​
 
You can select the folder (or file) and click on "Copy link" at the top bar to get the link:

You can also right-click the folder/file to copy the link:

​On previous versions, you can open the menu on ellipsis link and get it from there:
