<span class='intro'> You often need to share&#160;links&#160;to a file or folder in SharePoint. â€‹<br> </span>

<p>You can select the folder (or file) and click on &quot;Copy link&quot; at the top bar to get the link&#58;<br></p><dl class="image"><dt>
      <img src="/PublishingImages/sharepoint-cloud-copy-folder.jpg" alt="sharepoint-cloud-copy-folder.jpg" />
   </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Getting URL&#160;from SharePoint top bar

      <img src="/PublishingImages/sharepoint-link.jpg" alt="sharepoint-link.jpg" style="width&#58;800px;" />
