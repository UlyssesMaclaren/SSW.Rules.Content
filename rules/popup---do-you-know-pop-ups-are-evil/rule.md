Popups are intrusive and ugly.
   ​![Pop-ups are evil](../../assets/popup-evil.jpg) Figure: All popups are evil but this may be the most annoying one in history. How ironic that the popup is informing you that IE has blocked a popup. ![Pop-up on iPhone](../../assets/iphone-popup.jpg) Figure: Bad Example – Even popups are bad on the iPhone. In iOS5 this style of alerts have been banned (or at least, made optional)
