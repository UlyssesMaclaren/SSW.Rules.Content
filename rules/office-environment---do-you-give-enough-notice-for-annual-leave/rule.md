<span class='intro'> <p>
               <strong>​For employees&#58;</strong><br>
               Tell your managers and co-workers as soon as you know when you will be away. If you're planning to be away for any substantial amount of time (say 3 days or more), make sure you have told everyone who will need to know about 4 weeks in advance whenever possible. Most importantly, ensure that your clients are not left in a difficult position while you are gone.

                    Hi <span style="background-color&#58;#f5f5f5;">SSW Absence</span>​,<br>
                    I want to book a ticket to go to Brazil for 2 weeks.<br>

                <p>Generally, people who need to know include&#58;</p>
                <ol>  
                  <li>Your managers</li>

                  <li>Your close co-workers</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                <strong>For employers&#58;</strong><br>
                 Give your employees a bit of flexibility for small leav​e periods (say 1-2 days). As an employer, you should allow these small periods of leave with little to no notice.<br>
                 This will remove the incentive for employees to lie and say they are sick when they need time off with short notice.
