**​For employees:**
                Tell your managers and co-workers as soon as you know when you will be away. If you're planning to be away for any substantial amount of time (say 3 days or more), make sure you have told everyone who will need to know about 4 weeks in advance whenever possible. Most importantly, ensure that your clients are not left in a difficult position while you are gone.

<br>                    Hi SSW Absence,
<br>                    I'm going to Brazil for 2 weeks on Monday... wish me luck :)<br>                                          Figure: Bad Example - not enough notice for substantial leave                    [Appointment to SSWAbsence]

<br>                    Hi SSW Absence​,
<br>                    I want to book a ticket to go to Brazil for 2 weeks.
<br>                    I'd like to leave in about 4 weeks.
<br>                    Please approve<br>                    Figure: Good Example - appropriate notice given
Generally, people who need to know include:

1. Your managers
2. Your current client
3. Your close co-workers


**For employers:**
                  Give your employees a bit of flexibility for small leav​e periods (say 1-2 days). As an employer, you should allow these small periods of leave with little to no notice.
                  This will remove the incentive for employees to lie and say they are sick when they need time off with short notice.
