 If you’re building a website today, and your business needs to create addresses for different online directories, it can be confusing to figure out the best way to go about it. There’s a lot of debate about this topic on the internet, so the question to ask yourself is: “Should I use subdirectories or subdomains?”

Nowadays, it’s better to use subdirectories as they’re easier to maintain and less time-consuming in the long-term.

If you already have a domain and a lot of legacy structures in place, using subdirectories could be a big change and might not be worth it. You would need to update your properties in Google Analytics, your Google Search Console settings, a lot of redirects, and much more.

Google is smart enough to work it out – it would just be an extra step for Google’s bots. Watch the official video from [Google Webmasters​](https://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleWebmasterHelp) below on YouTube to find out more about this:
