<span class='intro'> 
  <p>We are now ready to make a new web application and site collection which we will need to match closely to the original SharePoint 2007 server. In the SharePoint 2010 server&#58;</p>
<ol>
    <li>Open <b>SharePoint Central Administration</b> | <b>Manage web applications</b></li>
    <li>Click on <b>New</b></li>
    <li>Enter in the details for the web application using the document from the rule <span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;">Do you document the details of your SharePoint 2007 web application?</span></li>
    <li>Go back to <b>SharePoint Central Administration </b>|<b> Create site collections</b></li>
    <li>Fill out the form to create a new site collection â€“ the only option that is important here is to create a <b>site collection that matches the site collection you will be migration. </b>Eg&#58; If the site collection you are migrating is a Team Site, make a site collection that is a Team Site. </li>
</ol>
<p>Note&#58; The rest do not matter as they will be replaced when you restore the database from SharePoint 2007.</p>
