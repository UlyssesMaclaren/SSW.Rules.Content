Public Websites done completely with Flash or Silverlight can be very eye-catching                     and used in the right spots can achieve way more than you can ever achieve with                     HTML. But beware because:
 
- It does not work on an iPhone or iPad
- Flash/Silverlight can be slow loading, especially if the visitor is not using a<br>                        fast Internet connection. If your website doesn't load within 5 seconds, they're<br>                        gone. (There are techniques to overcome this)
- It is bad for search engine rankings as there is no content for search engine spiders<br>                        to crawl through. (There are techniques to overcome this)
- Navigation via the back button (and Browser History). (There are techniques to overcome<br>                        this)
- Accessibility
- Often seen with busy designs that turn off or distract visitors. Look at the biggest<br>                        ecommerce sites and you notice that none of them are Flash websites
- In many cases it unnecessarily creates page bloat
- You can \*almost\* get the same effects and functionality using jQuery, but faster<br>                        and lighter
- You get an inconsistent UI if you use it for controls such as text boxes
- Flash and Silverlight do not support CSS, so you need to follow unfamilar concepts<br>                        for re-skinning


Finally, and saddest of all, when Flash/Silverlight is used, it is normally â€‹over used.


**Footnote #1:** It is clear that Flash has been quite successful - the penetration                         of its run time is 99% on PCs.

**Footnote #2:** Silverlight got up to 80%. Microsoft could get near                         100% if they included it with Windows Update.
