 Encouraging your team to evaluate their peers is a proven method to improve working environment and productivity.<br> 
All peers that worked together should evaluate each other by filling the [Peer Evaluation Email](http&#58;//intranet.ssw.com.au/accounting/Shared%20Documents/PeerEvaluationEmailTemplate.msg) every month.

The evaluation is done by ranking from top to bottom and giving constructive comments in “Start, Stop, Continue”
 e.g. (Start...) checking in with better comments  
 e.g. (Stop...) coding without a user story   
 e.g. (Continue...) with your helpful SEO comments

Note: Comments must have an option to be anonymous.

If you do not rank a listed peer it means that you have constructive comments to give them but are not qualified to assess the person’s value 
 e.g. an admin person evaluating a technician and vice versa; or a work experience person new to the company who feels qualified to give comments only.
