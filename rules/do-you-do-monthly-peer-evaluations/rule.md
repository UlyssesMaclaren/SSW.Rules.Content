<span class='intro'> Encouraging your team to evaluate their peers is a proven method to improve working environment and productivity. 
 </span>


  <p>All peers&#160;that worked together should evaluate each other by filling the <a href="/Management/RulesToBetterProjectManagement/Documents/PeerEvaluationEmailTemplate.msg" id="Peer Evaluation Email Template" name="Peer Evaluation Email Template" target="_blank">Peer Evaluation Email</a> every month.</p>
<p>The evaluation is done by ranking from top to bottom and giving constructive comments in “Start, Stop, Continue”<br>
e.g. (Start...) checking in with better comments&#160;&#160;<br>
e.g. (Stop...) coding without a user story&#160;&#160; <br>
e.g. (Continue...) with your helpful SEO comments</p>
<p>Note&#58; Comments must have an option to be anonymous.</p>
<p>If you do not rank a listed peer it means that you have constructive comments to give them but are not qualified to assess the person’s value <br>
e.g. an admin person evaluating a technician and vice versa; or a work experience person new to the company who feels qualified to give comments only.</p>
