<span class='intro'> <p>Every point of contact that you have with your customers is a potential to sell them something, whether that be other products or services or even to sell the company as a whole by saying how great we are.</p> </span>

<p>​Here are some examples of how we take advantage of every point of contact with our target market&#58;</p><ul><li style="padding-bottom&#58;0px;font-size&#58;1em;">At SSW we send a tech breakfast flyer with the invoices that we send via snail mail</li><li style="padding-bottom&#58;0px;font-size&#58;1em;">We give out SSW bags and flyers at our User Group</li><li style="padding-bottom&#58;0px;font-size&#58;1em;">Have advertisements at the bottom of our email footers</li><li style="padding-bottom&#58;0px;font-size&#58;1em;">All SSW staff wear SSW shirts when meeting with prospects/clients</li><li style="padding-bottom&#58;0px;font-size&#58;1em;">When we present at other events our slides are branded with the SSW logo</li></ul>
<p>We think that it's the little things like this that may make the difference!​</p>
