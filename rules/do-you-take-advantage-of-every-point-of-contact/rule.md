Every point of contact that you have with your customers is a potential to sell them something, whether that be other products or services or even to sell the company as a whole by saying how great we are.
 
​Here are some examples of how we take advantage of every point of contact with our target market:

- At SSW we send a tech breakfast flyer with the invoices that we send via snail mail
- We give out SSW bags and flyers at our User Group
- Have advertisements at the bottom of our email footers
- All SSW staff wear SSW shirts when meeting with prospects/clients
- When we present at other events our slides are branded with the SSW logo


We think that it's the little things like this that may make the difference!​
