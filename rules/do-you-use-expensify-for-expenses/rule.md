Tracking expenses can be a painful process of accumulating receipts and entering them into outdated systems… but there is a better way:<br>

[Expensify](https://www.expensify.com/) is a timesaver, both for the day to day user, as well as the accountant receiving the expenses.

As a user, all you have to do is take a photo of the receipt from your mobile app and add a comment (all other data is pulled in via OCR “Smart-scan”), then all of these expenses get batched together and sent on a weekly basis to the accountant, who can then manage them in bulk. 
Best of all… for light users… it’s free!
