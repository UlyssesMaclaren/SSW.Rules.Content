<span class='intro'> ​Tracking expenses can be a painful process of accumulating receipts and entering them into outdated systems… but there is a better way&#58;​<div>​<br><div><div class="ms-rtestate-read ms-rte-embedcode ms-rte-embedil ms-rtestate-notify"><iframe width="750" height="422" src="https&#58;//www.youtube.com/embed/UOl_Wq9LuVU" frameborder="0"></iframe>&#160;</div><br></div></div> </span>

<p>Expensify is a timesaver, both for the day to day user, as well as the accountant receiving the expenses.</p><p>​​As a user, all you have to do is take a photo of the receipt from your mobile app and add a comment (all other data is pulled in via OCR “Smart-scan”), then all of these expenses get batched together and sent on a weekly basis to the accountant, who can then manage them in bulk.&#160;<br>Best of all… for light users… it’s free!​<br></p><dl class="badImage"><dt>
