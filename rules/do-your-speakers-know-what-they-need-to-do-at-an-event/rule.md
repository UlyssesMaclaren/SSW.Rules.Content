Every event is prone to run over time for one or more segments of the day.​​
 
​​It is important to have one or more time keepers that makes sure speakers and breaks run to time. Even slipping 5 minutes a few times will mean a significant delay at the end of the day.

A few roles that might be worth assigning on the day are

- MC to entertain attendees when they are waiting as well as introducing key speakers
- Ushers in each room or location to get things started on time and wound up as well
