<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Every event is prone to run over time for one or more segments of the day.​​</p> </span>

<p>​​It is important to have one or more time keepers that makes sure speakers and breaks run to time. Even slipping 5 minutes a few times will mean a significant delay at the end of the day.</p><p>A few roles that might be worth assigning on the day are</p><ul><li>MC to entertain attendees when they are waiting as well as introducing key speakers</li><li>Ushers in each room or location to get things started on time and wound up as well</li></ul>
