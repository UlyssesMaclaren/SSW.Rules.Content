It is really important that your speakers feel empowered, so make sure you give them the tools they need to run their event well.
 
On the day of your event, great your speaker and give them a check list so they know how the day will run:

Eg. Good morning Brendan, here is your check list to ensure today's event goes well.

1. Tell the audience the agenda, and let them know the break times. You can stick the agenda up somewhere in the room if you would like to.

2. Draw yourself a rough diagram of the room, and go around the room and write people's names down for future reference. It will make speaking to them later a lot more personal if you can learn their name.

3. Ask them what coffee they would like, or ask them to fill out an electronic form. ​​Tip: If you draw the table layout before the arrive it is easier to locate people.

4. Breaks - we recommend the following breaks:

5. Please give your evaluation forms out around 4pm to give people time to complete them.
