It is really important that your speakers feel empowered, so make sure you give them the tools they need to run their event well.
 
On the day of your event, chat to the speaker and give them the speaker check list so they know how the day will run:

Eg. Good morning Brendan, here is your check list to ensure today's event goes well.

1. Tell the audience the agenda, so they know the break times.

We recommend the following breaks:
<dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="/PublishingImages/Schedule.jpg" alt="Schedule.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;"></dl>
**Figure: A schedule to give to your speakers to help with time keeping **

TIP: Attendees will often ask you what time the break starts or finished, you can [use this PDF​](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=b4899be4-831e-466d-a411-4580b4245ee2) to keep them informed, without answering the same question many times!

2. Draw yourself a rough diagram of the room, start with intros an​ then go around the room and write people's names down for future reference. It will make speaking to them later a lot more personal if you can learn their name.

​​Tip: Draw the table layout before people arrive - it's faster. It's also easy if you draw the view you see looking at the audience.
<dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="/PublishingImages/Diagram-Desk-layout2.jpg" alt="Diagram-Desk-layout2.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;600px;height&#58;450px;"></dl>
**Figure: An example of the room layout with attendee's name, and memorable things about them**



3. (Optional) Coffee Orders:

- ​Ask attendees what coffee they would like, or ask them to fill out an electronic form and give this to your admin staff


​5. Please give your evaluation forms out around 4pm to give people time to complete them.
