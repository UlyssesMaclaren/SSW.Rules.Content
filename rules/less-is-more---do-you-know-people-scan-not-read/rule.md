People rarely read word by word; instead, they scan the page, picking out individual words and sentences that seems more relevant.
 
It is important to divide information, not show it all at once. The visual organization of information is vital to legibility. When displaying information or controls, designers need to visually convey:

1. Information structure
2. Relation between elements
3. Importance and relevance of elements

Another example of scanning, not reading is visually mapping.
