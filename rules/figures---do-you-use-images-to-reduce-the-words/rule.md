An image is worth a thousand words, it's true. So if you can remove text and replace with an image, do so.

So we need a better way to present an image on our website and it should be easy enough to create a decent look.
 
You then have this pretty white flower with a green stem standing on a water pond. It is beautiful.
Figure: Bad example - Here we have text describing a flower
[[goodExample]]
| ![Here we have a picture ](flower.jpg)
(could be a screen capture) which avoids a thousand words
What else can you do?

- Use good captions - See <br>      [Do you add useful and bold figure text (aka a caption) to avoid a lot of text over images?](/Pages/add-useful-caption.aspx)
- Use good HTML - See <br>      [Do you use the right HTML/CSS code to add the useful figure/caption?](/Pages/use-the-right-HTML-CSS-code-to-add-the-useful-caption.aspx)
