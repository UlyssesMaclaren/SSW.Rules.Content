To maintain the stability of your server and help protect against harmful attacks, your server should only be running necessary services, and all software should have the latest updates.

This includes:
 
- Check that your operating system has the latest patches
- Check the system for software updates
- Check system event logs for software error reports
- Check the system is only running necessary services
