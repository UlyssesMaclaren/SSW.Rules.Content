Every week the project manager should meet with the client to conduct an external "Test Please" as well as to discuss the status of the release. While it is better to conduct an internal "test please" before the meeting, the update/debrief should proceed even if it hasn't been completed.

This is the agenda:
 
1. [Test please](/Standards/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/InternalTestPlease.aspx)
2. Status of original work items
3. Triage additional work items
4. Approval for additional work items/budget overruns
5. Release sign-off & deployment schedule
6. Approval of next release
7. Ask the client for a mark out of 10 for the release


You can use the [eXtreme Emails Release update/debrief](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/EXtremeEmails/ManageProjects.aspx#ReleaseDebrief) template or SSW's TFS add-in \*\*Link needed\*\* to easily confirm the outcome of the meeting by email.

**Promote your success**

If the debrief is the last one of the project always:

- Create a case study and get it approved - make sure it's branded nicely for the client
- Ask for a testimonial for the work you have done
- Add a link to the work you have done from your website or marketing material


At SSW we do this at [our Clients](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Company/OurClients.aspx) page
