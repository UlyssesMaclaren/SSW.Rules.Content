Having hundreds of emails in your inbox is not uncommon. But it's very uncommon to find people who successfully manage their inbox. Instead they let their inbox become a great black hole with no business value. Email has a bad name in business primarily because people don't treat email correctly. Email can be a vital tool to your company, and your software development project, but it has to be managed. Here's a [series of rules](/Standards/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/default.aspx) that govern how we use our Inbox.

We also use [SSW Exchange Reporter](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/ExchangeReporter/Default.aspx).
