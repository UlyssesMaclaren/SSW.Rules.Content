 ​Application Insights for Visual Studio Online gives you a great insight into how, when and where your website is used. 
​

Once deployed, Application Insights will start tracking metrics and interacting with your Visual Studio Online dashboards.

Application Insights tracks a lot of metrics in your website but one of the most useful is the breakdown of visits by each browser (IE, Chrome etc).
