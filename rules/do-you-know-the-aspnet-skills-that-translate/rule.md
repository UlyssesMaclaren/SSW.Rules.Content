<span class='intro'> This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). </span>

<p><span style="font-family&#58;'calibri','sans-serif';font-size&#58;11pt;" lang="EN-AU">This means that there are many skills that an ASP.NET developer already has that can be translated to SharePoint directly.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Master Pages – SharePoint uses master pages</li>
<li>Site Map – SharePoint uses the ASP.NET site map provider model and comes with many additional customized site map providers out of the box<br></li>
<li>Menu – SharePoint uses ASP.NET menu controls, powered by site maps<br></li>
<li>Page Control Lifecycle – the same key fundamental knowledge for ASP.NET is also necessary when making custom SharePoint development<br></li>
<li>Web.Config – like ASP.NET – many SharePoint configuration is done in the Web.Config – though SharePoint provides web UI to modify many of these options from Central Administration<br></li>
<li>.NET – Your .NET skills are definitely not going to go away<br></li>
<li>IIS – Each SharePoint web application is a “Site” in IIS, the site bindings are also identical<br></li></ul>
