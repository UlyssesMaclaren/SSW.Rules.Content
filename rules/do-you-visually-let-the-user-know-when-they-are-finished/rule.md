When a user reaches the last page of a wizard, a visual indication should be provided                     so that they know that the process has finished. We use a finish flag to do this.
 ![ Bad Example - This is the last page of the wizard but it is not obvious because the finish flag is small and the "Next" button still enabled![SSW Link Auditor - Finished](../../assets/GoodFlagImage.png) ](../../assets/BadFinishedPage.gif)
