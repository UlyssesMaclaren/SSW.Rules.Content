The corner stone of good user interface design is that if your users need instructions, you haven't done a good job. Of course with particularly complex applications there will be exceptions to this rule, but all developers should aim to make your interface as self evident as possible.

- There are no surprises
- There is no need to use help
- No excuse for RTFM (read the freaking manual)

A good UI is:

- Intuitive
- Feels fast - eg. no white screen, threading code
- Consistent
- Minimal popups
- No clutter - not busy
- Good error handling
- Easy to customize + apps (aka a platform)
- Gamification eg. badges

![Team Viewer Interface](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/GoodUITeamViewer.png)Good example: Teamviewer's interface requires very little explanation![Fly in a Urinal](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/FlyInUrinal.jpg)Figure: Good Example - See the fly? (an example of excellent usability) Dutch manufacturers realized that a fly painted on the urinal became a "target" for men using the facility. And the fly is positioned in precisely the right place for minimal spillage or splash back. Clever people those Dutch!
