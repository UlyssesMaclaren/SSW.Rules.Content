â€‹The best trace logging framework is Log4Net.

Did you know that writing your own logging infrastructure code wastes time.

Log4net is a NuGet package that can be included in any .Net application, is easy to configure, supports many different output targets, has great performance, and allows for runtime changes to configuration.
 
It also supports the concept of logging at different levels of importance (e.g. Error, Warning, Information) and having different logs for different components of your application (e.g. a Customer Log and an Order Log).

For example, log4net allows you to support the following scenarios by making configuration changes in XML config files.

On all non-development machines:

- Write all Error Log Messages to the Windows Event Log, the database and email them to the administrators group
- Write all Warning messages to the database and email them to the administrators group
- Write all Information messages to the database, and email any information messages in the Order component to the Order Fulfilment team for them to check


On development machines:

- Write all Error Log Messages to the database
- Write all Warning messages to the database
- Write all Information messages on the area I am currently developing to the database

Log4Net should be added to your project via the NuGet package manager.
