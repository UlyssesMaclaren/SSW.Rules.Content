​​                     The sandwich rule approach is an effective way to provide feedback to other team                     members and clients.
 
1. Start with positive feedback
2. Give your recommendations for improvement
3. End with some additional positive feedback (you may repeat #1)


This optimistic approach allows you to maintain a healthy relationship with your team members and clients.
