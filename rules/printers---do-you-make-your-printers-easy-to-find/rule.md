For PCs that are not in the domain, the printers wonâ€™t be automatically installed.

So you should add a DNS alias which maps \\printer to your print server.
![ \\printer takes to this window, were you can "Add" the printer via Connect](add-printer-via-connect.jpg)
Note: It is better to automate mappings via GPO preferences. As a backup, you can allow users to manually map as above.
