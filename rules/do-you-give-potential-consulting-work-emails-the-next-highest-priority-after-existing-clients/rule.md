 It is extremely important to demonstrate to potential clients a high level of quality service and attention to their needs; Whenever you receive an email from a potential client in relation to possible consulting work, you should make sure they receive an answer within 5 minutes of you receiving it. This is for 2 reasons: <br> 
- To show you are keen and to give an indication of the level of service they will receive
- To stop them "shopping around"


They will quickly recognize that they will not receive that kind of service anywhere else!
