The use of correct response codes is a simple yet crucial step, towards building a better WebAPI. By default, the WebAPI framework sets the response status code to 200 (OK), regardless if the task succeed or an error occurred.

You can **save yourself countless hours of painful debugging**, by specifying the correct response code.
 
For example: According to the HTTP/1.1 protocol, when a POST request results in the creation of a resource, the server should reply with status 201 (Created).

public Product PostProduct(Product item)
 {
     item = repository.Add(item);
     return item;
 }
Figure: Bad Example – By default a 200 status code is returned.
[ResponseType(typeof(CreditSnapshot))]
 public HttpResponseMessage PostProduct(Product item)
 {
     item = repository.Add(item);
     var response = Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.Created, item);

     return response;
 }
Figure: Good Example – When creating objects the “Created” status code is returned.  ​
