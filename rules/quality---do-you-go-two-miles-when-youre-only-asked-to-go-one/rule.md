This idea is different from the above rules in that it strikes at the heart of our                     everyday behaviour, not just when a crisis is looming. [Jesus of Nazareth](http&#58;//www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt%205&#58;41&amp;version=NKJV%3b) said:


"And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two."


While not everyone chooses                     to agree with everything He said, it's a valid point when it came to creating                     a positive team environment. If you're willing to help others above and beyond the                     call of duty,​ a whole ream of benefits flow:
 
- People begin to share responsibility for work that traditionally is claimed as "not my problem"
- Others will return the favour when you really need it
- The sense of work-place isolation disappears
- Productivity lifts as tasks can be achieved quicker
