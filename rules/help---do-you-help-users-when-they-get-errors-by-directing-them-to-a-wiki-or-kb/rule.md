Every message box should contain a link to a wiki or KB with more details about the message. In the example of the below error message:
   â€‹<dl class="badImage"><dt><img alt="No direct for this error" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/NoDirectForError.jpg"></dt>
<dd>Figure - Bad Example&#58; User now has to Google to find out how to fix this error</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img alt="Direct for this error" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/DirectForError.jpg"></dt>
<dd>Figure - Good Example&#58; If you click on the &quot;Get Help...&quot; link on the bottom of the form it will take you to a wiki page with common issues and resolutions</dd></dl>
