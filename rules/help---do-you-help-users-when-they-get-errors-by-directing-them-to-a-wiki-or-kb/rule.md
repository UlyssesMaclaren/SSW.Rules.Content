Every message box should contain a link to a wiki or KB with more details about the message. In the example of the below error message:
 
[[badExample]]
| ![User now has to Google to find out how to fix this error](../../assets/NoDirectForError.jpg)
[[goodExample]]
| ![If you click on the "Get Help..." link on the bottom of the form it will take you to a wiki page with common issues and resolutions](../../assets/DirectForError.jpg)
