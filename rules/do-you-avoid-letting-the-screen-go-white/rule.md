<span class='intro'> <p>Use jQuery or Ajax controls whenever possible to send requests without 
feedback on the process. This is to avoid a &quot;white&quot; blank page, while 
the page reloads. Similar ideas are like a save button that disables 
after the first click so it can't be hit multiple times.
                </p> </span>
