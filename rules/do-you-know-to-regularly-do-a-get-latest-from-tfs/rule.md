 It is important to regularly do a "Get Latest" to make sure you are using the most recent version of the code. In a team, if you go too long without doing a Get, you are more likely to encounter inconsistencies and will have to spend time merging your code. 
To find out when you or another developer last did a Get from TFS, use the Workspace Sidekick in [Team Foundation Sidekicks](http&#58;//www.attrice.info/cm/tfs/index.htm). If you're the TFS Master, you should do this every couple of weeks to make sure your team is always working with up-to-date code.
