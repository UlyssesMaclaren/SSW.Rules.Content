 When administrators need different credentials to login to a SharePoint site, there are different ways to implement it. 
​1. Obvious "Login" link:

Bad example: 'login' link 
2. Use little dot for a hidden link:

Bad example: little dot for a hidden link

3. Use /admin/ to let administrators to login (And WordPress is almost perfect how they use /wp-admin/):

Good example: Use /admin/ URL for administrators
