Let's say you press “Send” and get a bounce, eg. An email in your inbox that reads:

Delivery has failed to these recipients or distribution lists:

Adam Cogan ([adam@northwind.com](mailto&#58;adam@northwind.com))
 The recipient's e-mail address was not found in the recipient's e-mail system. Microsoft Exchange will not try to redeliver this message for you. Please check the e-mail address and try resending this message, or provide the following diagnostic text to your system administrator.

Get the correct email address and ‘Reply to all’ with just this text in brackets:
  (Resending with Adam’s correct email)
