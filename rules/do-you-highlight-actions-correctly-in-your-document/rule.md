​When highlighting items (file names, user commands etc.) be sure to:
 
1. ​Distinguish the items from the rest of the surrounding text; and
2. Be consistent.





Use the following rules to highlight items in your document.






| ​​Style​ | ​Use this style on​ | ​​Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ​**Bold text** | ​​Menus, commands, dialog box options, file names and paths​ | ​To access the application, click **Start | Programs | Accessories | System Tools | Disk Defragmenter** |
| ​UPPER CASE | ​Code keywords and database elements​ | ​​Use the INNER JOIN clause in SQL Server to join one table to another.​ |
| ​**Initial Capitals + Bold** | ​File paths and file names​ | ​	Now open **C:\My Documents\Invoice.doc.** |
| ​Monospace (Courier New font) | ​Code samples, error messages​ | ​You will see the following error: error opening database: database is currently in use. |




Remember: Never Underline the text when it isn't a link as per the rule: [Do you use underlines only on links?​](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/rules/RulesToBetterWebsitesNavigation.aspx#DontUseUnderlines)
