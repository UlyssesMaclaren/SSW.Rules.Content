​​​CRM 2013 has a nice way of reducing the amount of work needed to create a new Account, Contact, and opportunity, all via making a Lead 1st.

The process is:​
 
1. In CRM, create a Lead
2. Convert it into an Opportunity, Contact and Account using the Qualify button
![Become familiar with the 'Convert Lead' button](/Communication/RulesToBetterCRMForUsers/PublishingImages/CRM_ConvertLead.jpg)Figure: Become familiar with the "Qualify" button    Clicking on the "Qualify" button allows the automatic generation of Accounts, Contacts and Opportunities, and also allows you to check for potential duplicates being created.

3. Deactivate the Lead
4. Create an Opportunity, Contact and Account
5. Automatically link the Opportunity to the Account and the Account to the Contact

This will save you substantial amount of time compared to creating and linking each one manually.
