All CRM users should be able to walk through this simple workflow.
 
The process is:

1. In CRM, create a Lead
2. Convert it into an Opportunity, Contact and Account using the Qualify button
<dl class="image">                    <dt><img alt="Become familiar with the 'Convert Lead' button" src="/Communication/RulesToBetterCRMForUsers/PublishingImages/CRM_ConvertLead.jpg"></dt>
                    <dd>Figure&#58; Become familiar with the Qualify&quot; button</dd>
                </dl>    Clicking on the "Qualify" button allows the automatic generation of Accounts, Contacts and Opportunities.
<dl class="image">                    <dt><img alt="Convert Lead Web Page Dialog" src="/Communication/RulesToBetterCRMForUsers/PublishingImages/CRM_ConvertLeadDialg.jpg"></dt>
                    <dd>Figure&#58; Qualify Lead Web Page Dialog</dd>
                </dl>    This will:
3. Deactivate the Lead
4. Create an Opportunity and Account
5. Automatically link the Opportunity to the Account and the Account to the Contact

<dl class="image">                <dt><img alt="Link to Account from Opportunity" src="/Communication/RulesToBetterCRMForUsers/PublishingImages/CRM_LinkToAccount.jpg"></dt>
                <dd>Figure&#58; Link to Account from Opportunity</dd>
            </dl>
This will save you substantial amount of time compared to creating and linking each one manually.
