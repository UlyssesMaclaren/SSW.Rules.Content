 When booking in client work always make sure you ask the client to gather enough work for 8 hours of work. The minimum amount of time per booking is 8 hours. See Rules to Better Sales Account Management - <br>[Do you book in a minimum of 1 day's work at a time?](/Management/RulesToSuccessfulSalesAndAccountManagement/Pages/Book-in-a-minimum-of-1-day-work-at-a-time.aspx)
