<span class='intro'> ​​Excess punctuation without a purpose can make a document or web page look overly busy. For a list of short sentences, don't&#160;have full stops at the end of each bullet point. The exception to this rule is when you have more than one sentence in a single bullet point.<br><div><br></div> </span>

<p>For example&#58;</p><dt class="greyBox"><ul><li>Sentence 1.</li><li>Sentence 2.</li><li>Sentence 3.</li></ul></dt><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Bad Example - Too much punctuation</dd> 
<br> 
<dt class="greyBox"><ul><li>Sentence 1​<br></li><li>Sentence 2. Sentence 3</li><li>Sentence 4</li></ul></dt><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good Example - Full stop is only used in the bullet point that has multiple sentences, except in the last one​</dd>
