Excess punctuation without a purpose can make a document or web page look overly busy. For a list of  **short sentences**  and for  **figure captions** , don't add full stops at the end. The exception to this rule is when you have more than one sentence, then only avoid the full stop in the  **last sentence** .
 
For example:

- Sentence 1.
- Sentence 2.
- Sentence 3.

Figure: Bad Example - Too much punctuation

- Sentence 1
- Sentence 2. Sentence 3
- Sentence 4

Figure: Good Example - Full stop is only used in the bullet point that has multiple sentences, except in the last one
