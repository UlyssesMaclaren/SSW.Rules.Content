You can see details about your Azure DevOps Server (formerly known as TFS) projects directly in your Microsoft Teams channel. Examples of what you can monitor:

- Work item updates
- Pull requests
- Code commits
- Builds
- Release deployments and approvals


Also bring your Azure DevOps Services Kanban board directly into Microsoft Teams as a tab.
