<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​Just like when going to work it is good to have a space that is completely dedicated to your job. This will allow you to get into a work mindset when in this space, but also at the end of the day or during breaks allow you to remove yourself from the work environment.<br></p> </span>

<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​Having downtime from work is important for your mental health so don not turn your entire home into your workspace.​<br></p>
