 ​Don't waste time evaluating which Web UI libraries to use. Most of the commonly used libraries are very similar in functionality​. ​The recommend​ library is **[Twitter Bootstrap](/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterMVC/Pages/Do-you-use-Twitter-Bootstrap.aspx)**. 
It's the most popular available framework today, which means more people involved in the project, more tutorials and articles from the community, more real-world examples/websites, more third-party extensions, and better integration with other​ web development products
![zurb.png](/DesignandPresentation/RulestoBetterInterfacesGeneral/PublishingImages/zurb.png)Figure: Bad example - Zurb Foundation is the second most popular, but it uses Sass files and​ has the worst name
**Note:** Zurb Foundation was always out of date on nuget. So if you use it (not recommended) download direct from ​Github
![bootstrap.png](/DesignandPresentation/RulestoBetterInterfacesGeneral/PublishingImages/bootstrap.png)Figure: Good example - leader among frameworks today, Boostrap toolkit is recommended to build​ successful websites
### Other useful frameworks

- ​**[KendoUI](http&#58;//www.kendoui.com/)** for enhanced HTML and jQuery controls
- [**KnockoutJS**](http&#58;//knockoutjs.com/) for view-model data binding
- **[SignalR](http&#58;//signalr.net/) **for real-time web functionality​
