Directly querying the table bypasses the security and filtering of MSCRM as well           as not being supported by Microsoft. Thisâ€‹ is not the correct method for reports           to be written.           
           The correct filtered views can be found under the Views section of the CRM database           and these are the Views that should always be used to design SQL Reporting Services           reports.

In CRM 2011 using Filtered Views is enforced with data connector, direct access to tables and other views will be denied.
