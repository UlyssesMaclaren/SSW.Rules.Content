<span class='intro'> <p>With VS2013, you get the long awaited 64 bit edit and continue, and it is turned on by default. Edit and Continue is great when you need to make a quick change to executing code. However, it has its downsides too&#58;​</p><ul><li>
            Web Development - Kills IISExpress when you stop</li><li>
            Can lead to bad development practices (trying to debug instead of doing RED, GREEN, REFACTOR)</li></ul>
<br> </span>

<p>​This is why we recommend that it is turned OFF by default.​​</p>
