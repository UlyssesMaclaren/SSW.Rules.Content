Usually the person leading the meeting is audible because they’ll using be a mic, but if others want to talk, they should come up next to the presenter and speak – this is important so people who are attending the meeting remotely can hear what is happening.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s worse when there are multiple conversations going on – let one person speak at a time, and make sure they’re close to the mic.
