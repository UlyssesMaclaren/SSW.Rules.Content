<span class='intro'> You should always breakdown a task, by creating sub-tasks, until you are comfortable with the overall estimate. 
 </span>


  <p>The reason for having this feeling is that the task is not broken down enough and appears difficult to breakdown because there are unknowns.&#160;&#160; For a simple example, a task of a story is to produce something for the story and it is not known how yet.&#160; Rather than put an estimate for the task that seems risky or low, break it down into at least two-sub tasks of&#58;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Investigate best option to produce result </li>
    <li>Implement best option and produce result </li>
</ul>
<p>The estimate for the second sub-task might be tough but you must make your best estimate to ensure the burndown is as accurate as possible.&#160; Once the first sub-task is complete then the second sub-task can be updated in both description and estimate as appropriate.&#160;&#160; Other people can then clearly see what is transpiring.</p>
