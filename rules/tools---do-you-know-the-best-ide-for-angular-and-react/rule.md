When developing Angular or React, there are lots of choices for code editors. The best experience by far is to use [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).   
 
[[goodExample]]

Many experienced teams are using Visual Studio for their C# backend and loving using Visual Studio Code for their Angular or React projects.

The recommended extension for Visual Studio Code is `**Angular Essentials**` from John Papa

**Angular Essentials **is actually a meta-package that includes a list of great extensions for Angular Development â€“ and this list may be updated in the future as more extensions become popular.

See     [https://github.com/johnpapa/vscode-angular-essentials](https://github.com/johnpapa/vscode-angular-essentials).
