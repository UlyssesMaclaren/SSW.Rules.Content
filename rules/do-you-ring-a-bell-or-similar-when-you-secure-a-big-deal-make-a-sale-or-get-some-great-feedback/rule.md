 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 
At SSW whenever a big new project is signed up or we sell an enterprise license for one of our products we send an email to all staff and then ring the bell, which is located in the middle of the office.

Similarly, when we get some feedback we will send around an email, and store the email in a public folder.
