Most people don’t pay much attention to their boarding pass beyond their gate and seat number, but if you know what to look for, there’s a lot of information stored on a boarding pass!

 
**PRN reference: **Passenger Name Record. It’s a six-digit alphanumeric code.
**Sequence:** This is the order in which you checked in to your flight, e.g. if your sequence number is 066 you’re the 66th person to check in.
**Boarding door: **Have you noticed this, which tells you whether to board the plane from the front or rear?
**SSSS: **Secondary Security Screening Selection picks passengers either at random or due to red flags (such as buying a one-way ticket with cash).
