There is a lot of information tucked away in your web server log files. Valuable, but often unused, information that can be retrieved from your web server log files include:
 
- Geographical origin of users
- Referring pages (which external pages did the users come from e.g. search engines)
- Number of users
- Time spent on the website
- Reasons for user's early departure
- Popularity of pages within your website
