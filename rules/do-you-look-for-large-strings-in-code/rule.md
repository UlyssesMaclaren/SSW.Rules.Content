Long hard-coded strings in a codebase can be a sign of poor architecture.
 
â€‹To make hard-coded strings easier to find, [consider highlighting them in your IDE](/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterDotNETProjects/Pages/HlightStrings.aspx).

Figure: Bad Example - The connection string is hard-coded and isn't easy to see in the IDE.![longstringbadexample2.png](/SoftwareDevelopment/RulestobetterArchitectureandCodeReview/PublishingImages/longstringbadexample2.png)
Figure: Better Example - The connection string is still hard-coded, but at least it's very visible to the developers.![longstringgood.png](/SoftwareDevelopment/RulestobetterArchitectureandCodeReview/PublishingImages/ShortStrings.png)
Figure: Good Example - The connection string is now stored in configuration and we don't have a long hard-coded string in the code.
