One of the few disadvantages of videos over written content is that Google can't tell much about your video apart from the title and tags you may provide when you upload it. By having your video transcribed and adding the transcription text to wherever the video is shown, you're giving Google specific information about the content of your video.   
It also helps people to copy and paste important parts of what's said on the video.

There are many websites that provide transcription services. We recommended:

- [https://www.speechpad.com](https&#58;//www.speechpad.com/) - for a better transcription quality
- [https://www.fiverr.com](https&#58;//www.fiverr.com/)  - for a quicker reply and cheaper pricing
