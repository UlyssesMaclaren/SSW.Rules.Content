Like any development, performance optimization requires development time and should therefore be prioritized for business value.

Include the following considerations:

- What is the preferred performance for this feature?
- What represents an acceptable performance metric?
- How many users are expected to use this feature within a timeframe?
- What is the business impact of poor performance for this feature?
- Are we planning to significantly change this feature in the near future?
