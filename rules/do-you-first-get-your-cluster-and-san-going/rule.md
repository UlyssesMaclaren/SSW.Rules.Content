This is an advanced topic. The pre-requisites are that you already have Clustered nodes setup, and then your SAN.

Then you enable your Hyper-V role on your cluster.

First refer to all rules listed in "[Rules to Better Hyper-V](/ITAndNetworking/RulesToBetterHyperV/Pages/default.aspx)" as these are the basics for Hyper-V.

Let's continue with the rules specially for clustering...
