This is an advanced topic. The pre-requisites are that you already have Clustered nodes setup, and then your SAN.

Then you enable your Hyper-V role on your cluster.

First refer to all rules listed in "[Rules to Better Hyper-V](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=0ab13b4a-0d1e-4371-a527-cf4a611c67df)" as these are the basics for Hyper-V.

Let's continue with the rules specially for clustering...
