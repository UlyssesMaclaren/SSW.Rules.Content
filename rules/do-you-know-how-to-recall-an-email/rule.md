<span class='intro'> Even though you may check your emails before sending, use SSW lookout to help you avoid mistakes, and even if you send/receive manually, there will still be times where you will send out an email with mistakes or incorrect content.
 </span>


  <p>But all is not lost. If you go into your sent items, open up the offending email, and go into Actions | Recall this Message, outlook will attempt to delete the message from the recipient's inbox before he has a chance to read it. </p>
<img src="/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/RecallMessage.JPG" alt="Recall a message" class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" /> <span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Actions | Recall this Message</span>
<p>Outlook will tell you whether it was successful or not</p>
