 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 
But all is not lost. If you go into your sent items, open up the offending email, and go into Actions | Recall this Message, outlook will attempt to delete the message from the recipient's inbox before he has a chance to read it.
![Recall a message](/Standards/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/RecallMessage.JPG) Figure: Actions | Recall this Message
Outlook will tell you whether it was successful or not
