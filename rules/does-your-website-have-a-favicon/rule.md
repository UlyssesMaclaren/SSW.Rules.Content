Don't forget to add a favicon to the address bar of your website! That extra bit of polish gives your site credibility.
 
Simply add the following within the head tags on your document:

      &lt;head&gt;
<br>      &lt;LINK REL="SHORTCUT ICON" HREF="/ssw/Images/icossw\_v2.ico"&gt;
<br>      &lt;/head&gt;
