<span class='intro'> <p>
                    Once a project gets underway, it is not uncommon for the lead developer to take
                    over a lot of the project management workload. Since they are the person most in
                    contact with the client, sometimes new work will be organized through them instead
                    of the Account Manager.
                </p> </span>

 <p>
                    When this is the case, the &quot;As per our conversation&quot; email should CC the Account Manager
                    so he is always aware of all work being done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If an initial meeting is required for the new work, the Account Manager should be in attendance
                    where possible to help continue the relationship.

                        <p>Hi Bill,<br>
                           As per our conversation, you want me to work for another 2 weeks to work on this additional work.</p>
