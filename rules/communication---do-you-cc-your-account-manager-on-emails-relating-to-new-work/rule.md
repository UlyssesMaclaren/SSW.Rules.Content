Once a project gets underway, it is not uncommon for the development team to take                     over a lot of the project management workload. Since they are the people most in                     contact with the client, sometimes new work will be organized through them instead                     of the Account Manager.
 
When this is the case, the "As per our conversation" email should CC the Account Manager                     so he is always aware of all work being done, and can create a [new CRM opportunity](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=c797ad7b-cbb5-4266-8687-e5ca52c1aa6d) if required.

If an initial meeting is required for the new work, the Account Manager should be in attendance                     where possible to help continue the relationship.

Hi Bill,
                            As per our conversation, you want to book me for another 2 weeks on this additional work.
Figure: Good Example - the account manager should be CCed on an email like this.
