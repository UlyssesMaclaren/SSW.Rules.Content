 ​Email signatures are a great way of adding some advertising and branding. You should always [use a nice email signature](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=73dea04c-b017-4c65-816e-aef8c84497be) for **external emails**.
Internally, you shouldn't use any or just use a short one (just your​ name or initials)

 
### What about appointments?​

Appointments going to people outside the organisation should be written and addressed the way you would an email. This includes using your email signature.
