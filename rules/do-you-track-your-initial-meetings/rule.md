When creating an appointment email for an initial meeting, make sure you include the words " **initial** " and " **meeting** " on the subject. 

[[greyBox | Bad subject - not clear it is an initial meeting]]
|  Subject:  Northwind project with SSW and Bob
|

[[greyBox | Good subjects - Make clear it is an initial meeting by having both words]]
|  Subject: Initial meeting with SSW and Bob from Northwind
| Subject: Initial phone meeting with SSW and Bob from Northwind
|
