It is important that users of your application who provide feedback <br>have very clear indications of work that is not yet complete, to avoid <br>feedback on sections of your application that are still under <br>development.
 
Also, see our [rule on color usage in windows forms](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/rules/rulestobetterwindowsforms.aspx#RedYellowDesigner).
![](http&#58;//skunk/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/bad-incomplete-work.jpg)Figure: Bad Example - A tester or a product <br>owner who comes to this page may believe that it is broken, or that the <br>developers have 'missed' it. Always be clear about what parts of your <br>application are not yet ready for feedback![](http&#58;//skunk/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/good-incomplete-work.jpg)Figure: Good Example - It is clear to testers <br>and to the product owner that this page is incomplete, but they can get <br>more details from the product backlog![](http&#58;//skunk/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/best-incomplete-work.jpg)Figure: Best Example - Use feature toggles to not show incomplete elements to testers or product owners. See [FeatureToggle by Martin Fowler](http&#58;//martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html).<br> Feature Toggling can require a large amount of extra work and so is <br>often only implemented by teams with a need to ship features while <br>others are still in development
