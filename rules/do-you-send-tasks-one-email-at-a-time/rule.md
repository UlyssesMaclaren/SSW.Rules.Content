 Do you sometimes find that people don't attend to all the items you have listed in your long and carefully drafted email?<br> 
Make it easier for everyone to track the status of tasks by sending tasks one email at a time, and make the task it requests very clear. When a person has completed a task they just have to reply "Done" to that email, delete the email from their Inbox and then move on to the next task.

This rule can be by-passed when dealing with small tasks relating to the same topic. In cases where this is needed, you should number each task that you wish to be completed; however, the person completing the task should still reply a single "Done" to the whole email once they have completed all of the small tasks.

Also send separate emails per topic - that way there can be one email per topic. The advantages are that you get an email history on a specific topic and it is easier to include someone else.
