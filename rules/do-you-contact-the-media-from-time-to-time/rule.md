It is important for us to contact the media from time to time as they are the people who can get our products and services out to the world easily. It is a good way to advertise products.
 
When you find a media contact you think is appropriate to contact, add them to CRM then tag them as MEDIAJ - Media - Journalist.

Then send an email like this:
