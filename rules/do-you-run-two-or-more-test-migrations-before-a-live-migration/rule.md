​It is recommended that you should run at least 2 or more successful test migrations before running a live migration. The following steps describe the process of setting up a test environment for migration:
​ 
​Back up your CRM 3 existing environment including customizations, custom codes, sitemap...

1. Configure a new environment with SQL Server and all necessary components (Do not install CRM yet!)
2. Restore database that you have backup from existing environment​ to the new environment
3. Redeploy CRM to the new environment
4. Test to see if the new environment works as expected
5. Upgrade the new environment to CRM 4
6. ​Test the new environment after upgrading​
