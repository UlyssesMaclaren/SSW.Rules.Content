<span class='intro'> 
  <ul>
    <li>When working on packaging SharePoint artefacts into Features &amp; Solutions, you should always make small incremental changes to your VSeWSS projects. Each time you should build &amp; deploy to check you haven't broken anything. </li>
    <li>You should regularly make labels in TFS so you can quickly compare your changes against previous working versions to identify problems. </li>
</ul>
 </span>
