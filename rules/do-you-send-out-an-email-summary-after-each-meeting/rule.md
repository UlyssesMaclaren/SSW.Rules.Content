<span class='intro'> <p>​After a meeting, you should summarise the main issues and decisions of the meeting, generating actionable tasks and delegating them to the appropriate&#160;person. ​The level of detail in the communication should suit the type of meeting, but should at least include a bullet point list of agenda items or any announcements made at the meeting.&#160;<br></p><p>This can also be used&#160;as a reference for those who did attend the meeting.​<br></p> </span>
