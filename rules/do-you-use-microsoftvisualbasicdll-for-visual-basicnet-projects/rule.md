 The Microsoft.VisualBasic library is provided to ease the implementation of the VB.NET language itself. For VB.NET, it provides some methods familiar to the VB developers and can be seen as a helper library. It is a core part of the .NET redistribution and maps common VB syntax to framework equivalents, without it some of the code may seem foreign to VB programmers. <br>

| --- | --- |
| CInt, CStr  | Convert.ToInt(...), ToString()  |
| vbCrLf  | Environment.NewLine, or "\r\n"  |
| MsgBox  | MessageBox.Show(...)  |
