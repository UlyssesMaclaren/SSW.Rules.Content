Always use a green tick for a good example and red cross for a bad example followed with a label “Figure:”?

[[greyBox]]
|  Bad example - background colour is manually added to &lt;tablegt; tag
| <br> 
Bad example – example isn’t labelled with the X symbol followed by ‘Figure:’ 

[[goodExample]]
|  Figure: Bad example - background colour is manually added to &lt;tablegt; tag 
Figure: Good example – It is clear that this example is incorrect.
 

[[goodExample | background colour is automatically added to &lt;tablegt; tag 
Figure: Good example – It is clear that this example is correct.]]
