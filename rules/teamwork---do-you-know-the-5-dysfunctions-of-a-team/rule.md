<span class='intro'> <p class="p1">​There are five interrelated issues that undermine the performance of a team&#58;</p><ol class="ol1"><li class="li1"><b>Absence of trust.&#160;</b><br>
If the members of the team do not trust each other then they cannot be totally honest with each other.</li><li class="li1"><b>Fear of conflict. </b><br>Without trust people will not have the healthy debates that are necessary to arrive at better thought through decisions.</li><li class="li1"><b>Lack of commitment. </b><br>If the team have not aligned behind a decision then the individual members who did not agree with the final decision will ultimately be less committed to that decision.</li><li class="li1"><b>Avoidance of accountability. </b><br>If they are not committed to the course of action, then they are less likely to feel accountable (or hold other people accountable).</li><li class="li1"><b>Inattention to results. </b><br>Consequently, they are less likely to care about the group results (and instead focus on achieving their own goals).</li></ol> </span>
