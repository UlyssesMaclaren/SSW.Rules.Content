Figure: Sample Morning Goals Email 

- Forward the previous morning goal from yesterday, striking out completed items
- Comment (in a different colour) and give the reason whether any items were not completed
- Copy outstanding items to today's morning goals, appending any new information
- If we are working on-site we always send our morning goals from our SSW mail account, not an internal account the client may choose to give us. This enables us to keep a record of the email, and also keeps the branding consistent. If this is not possible, we always CC our SSW account (and then move the emails into your "[Saved Items](/Standards/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/SaveImportantItemsInSeparateFolder.aspx)" when you get back to the office)
- If something more important arises during the day, we note it down on the next days morning goals.
- If a task is huge (e.g. clean up my email inbox) and we only aim to do a portion of it, we say so in the morning goals as well.
