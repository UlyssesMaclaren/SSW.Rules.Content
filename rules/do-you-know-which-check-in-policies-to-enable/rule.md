Check-in policies are a great tool to enforce quality code before it hits your source control repository. SSW recommends that the following check-in policies be enabled by default on your project:
 
1. Changeset Comments Policy - To enforce that all check-in contain comments
2. SSW Code Auditor - To enforce coding standards and best practices before check-in
3. Testing Policy - To enforce that unit tests should all pass before code can be checked-in
4. Code Analysis Policy – To enforce that code analysis rules are not broken
5. ​Builds Policy – To enforce that the developer has built the project end to end before they check-in


**More Information**

To enable these policies:

1. Right click the **Team Project in Team Explorer > Team Project Settings > Source Control**
2. Select the check-in policies above
3. Click **OK**
