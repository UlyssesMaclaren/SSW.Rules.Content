<span class='intro'> This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). </span>


  <p>So you are talking to a client about their ice cream chain?</p>
<dl class="bad">
    <dt>How many outlets do you have? <br>
    Where is the main outlet? </dt>
    <dd>Figure&#58; Bad examples - you should already know the answers to these questions by use of research tools such as the Internet</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="good">
    <dt>I noticed you have x amount of outlets, are you planning to open up more, when and where?<br>
    Which of your products contribute most to your gross profit?<br>
    How do most of your customers hear about you?<br>
    Do you have a customer loyalty program? Is it working?<br>
    Where are some of the biggest challenges / opportunities for you at the moment / in the future? </dt>
    <dd>Figure&#58; Good Examples</dd>
</dl>
<p>By asking questions, you show interest as well as initiating conversation - remember to get the customer talking.</p>
<p>Look for points of pain and build on them - if there's no pain it's hard to fix the problem properly.</p>
