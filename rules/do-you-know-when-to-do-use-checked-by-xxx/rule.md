 ​There are times you should have your email checked by someone else before sending. Examples are:

- Where you are a little unsure
- When you are new to a company and sending an email to a large distribution list
- Sending a complicated email
- Sending a sensitive email (where the content could be perceived as confrontational)
- When you need a quick "[test please](/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/InternalTestPlease.aspx)" an​d the person is available on the spot


Doing this will ensure:

- You avoid grammatical and spelling errors
- The layout and tone of the email is professional
- You haven’t forgotten anything important
- The receiver knows who else agrees with the content
