 ​Replying inline should be the exception rather than the rule as it messes up the history of the email thread. If you do - copy and paste the entire email in your reply and comment on each issue at a time. It's useful to write your comments in red. And make sure what you type should always be aligned left, not indented. Remember, if you write emails with one issue at a time you won't need to do this too often.<br>

Figure: Good Example - See the "Reply In-line" comment, and see how the RED makes the email easier to read.

However, it is not recommended to use inline comments. ​See [Top 10 Rules to Better Email](http&#58;//tv.ssw.com/4818/top-5-rules-better-email-ulysses-maclaren) video for more details on how to reply to emails.
