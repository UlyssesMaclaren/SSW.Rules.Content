In conjunction with [regular check-ins](/Pages/CheckinRegularly.aspx), files in source control should never be locked unless absolutely necessary. Use either 'Unchanged - Keep any existing lock' - or 'None - Allow shared checkout'.
 
Only use 'Check Out - Prevent other users from checking out and checking in' when checking out binary files e.g. Word documents or third party compiled dllâ€™s. (This will be the default this will be the selected option due to the inability for binary files to be merged on check in.)

Do not enforce single check-out at the project level - make sure the 'Enable multiple check-out' option is ticked under Team Project Settings, Source Control.
