It is a good idea to create a dummy company to represent all clients on internal documentation, including a made-up name for the person behind that company. At SSW, anytime we need an example of dealing with clients, we use the made-up company called "Northwind" which is managed by the also made-up client "Mr. Bob Northwind", often referred to as just "Bob".
 
Most of documentation starts from a real world situation and we don't want to expose our real clients names.

**Hi ****Mark Zuckerberg**,
We need to make sure our project with **Facebook** will be approved before summer.
