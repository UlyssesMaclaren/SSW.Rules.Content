 This is how you create a rule at **rules.ssw.com.au**. 
1. Log in to [http://rules.ssw.com.au/admin/Pages/default.aspx](/admin/Pages/default.aspx)
2. Go to the category index. E.g For “Communication” go to http://rules.ssw.com.au/Communicatio n/Pages/default.aspx
3. Then to the subcategory E.g. http://rules.ssw.com.au/Communication/RulesToBetterSomething 
**Note:** It's very **important **to make sure you are at the right location before creating a rule!!! 
**Note: **Step 2 & 3 are not needed anymore after we moved all rule pages from 100+ subwebs into one "Pages" library in root web.
4. Click on “Add a page” <br>      ![Create Rule](/PublishingImages/create-rule1.jpg)**Note:** Each rule will be a “page” on SharePoint – with its own URL - differently from old aspx, where rules were sections on a single page.
5. Add the URL <br>      ![Create Rule](/PublishingImages/create-rule2.jpg)    **Note:** We use only the most important words of a rule title. The words in **purple** are typically not used.
    E.g. #1 “**HTML/CSS - Do you know how to create spaces in a web page?**” should be “http://rules.ssw.com.au/WebSites/RulesToBetterWebsitesLayout/Pages/How-to-create-spaces-in-a-web-page.aspx”
    E.g. #2 “**Do you use "list" tags for lists only?**” should be “http://rules.ssw.com.au/WebSites/RulesToBetterWebsitesLayout/Pages/Use-list-tags-for-lists-only.aspx”

Note: Friendly URL should be automatically generated like:
![auto-generate-friendlyurl.jpg](/PublishingImages/auto-generate-friendlyurl.jpg)
6. Add the rule title![Create Rule](/PublishingImages/create-rule3.jpg)
7. Add the rule category (so that it will be shown on the summary page):![add-rule-category.jpg](/PublishingImages/add-rule-category.jpg)
8. ​​**IMPORTANT** – Adding rule intro + content <br>          You have three options: ​

    1. ​​**Option 1** – Start from scratch - Write content down on the fields
    2. ​​**Option 2** - Paste the content from another place - a HTML page on the browser or a Word document  <br>                    Warning: Select the “**Paste Plaintext**” when pasting or you will have a lot of work later
![Create Rule](/PublishingImages/create-rule4.jpg)Figure: Good Example - If you don’t select this, SharePoint will generate a lot of inline styling, which will cause triple work to fix.![Create Rule](/PublishingImages/create-rule5.jpg)Figure: Terrible example of a HTML generated by pasting normally – not plaintext. All the margins, font family, external images aren’t necessary        Since you have pasted the plain text, you’ll need to manually add the styling - headings, links, captions etc.
![Create Rule](/PublishingImages/create-rule6.jpg)Figure: Add the styles. In SharePoint is very similar to Microsoft Word. The custom styles will have pretty much everything you'll need without having to touch the HTML code
    3. **Option 3** - Paste the HTML code (recommended if you already have the content in the internet and the HTML is neat enough)
        1. Open up and copy the HTML code (from “view source” on a browser)
        2. Go back to SharePoint (where you are adding the rule)
        3. Click in the field you are going to edit
        4. In the “Format Text” ribbon, click “Edit Source” <br>                  ![Create Rule](/PublishingImages/create-rule7.jpg)
        5. Paste the HTML there <br>                  ![Create Rule](/PublishingImages/create-rule8.jpg)
        6. Now fix up the images – This part is a bit painful
            - Firstly you will need to save all the images to your local drive
            - We don’t use the "Insert &gt; Picture" on the ribbon because it doesn’t generate the HTML code we use as default as per [Do you use the right HTML/CSS code to add the useful figure/caption?](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulestoBetterWebsiteslayout.aspx#AddFigureWithRightCode)
            - Instead, upload them to the Images folder - http://rules.ssw.com.au/PublishingImages/
                - Go to “Site Contents” <br>                              ![Create Rule](/PublishingImages/create-rule9.jpg)
                - Click on “Images” <br>                              ![Create Rule](/PublishingImages/create-rule10.jpg)
                - Drag the images from your local drive to the Images folder in SharePoint: <br>                              ![Create Rule](/PublishingImages/create-rule11.jpg)
                - Make sure you “Check In” all the images (otherwise they won’t be visible for anonymous users) <br>                              ![Create Rule](/PublishingImages/create-rule12.jpg)
                - On the screen above you can see the path for each image. Copy it so you can paste into the HTML.
E.g. &lt;img src=”http://rules.ssw.com.au/Communication/RulesToBetterBlogging/PublishingImages/RulesBloggingAcknowledgeBad.jpg"&gt;
        7. Double check the links – you might have got a relative link E.g. **&lt;a href=”../company/Offices.aspx”&gt; **which will not work because it’s now on a different site.
So you will nee​d to make it absolute E.g. **&lt;a href=”**[**http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/company/Offices.aspx**](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/)**”&gt;**
9. Add the rule intro <br>          Try to have a catch at the end so the user will want to read the rest of the rule. E.g. “ To reply to a bug effectively and efficiently in your emails, you need to include:”
![Create Rule](/PublishingImages/create-rule13.jpg)![Create Rule](/PublishingImages/create-rule14.jpg)Figure: The “Brief Blurb” should clearly explain what the rule is about and have a catch at the end
10. Add the rule content <br>      ![Create Rule](/PublishingImages/create-rule15.jpg)
11. [Add the acknowledgements](/Pages/add-acknowledgements-to-rules.aspx)![Create Rule](/PublishingImages/create-rule16.jpg)
12. Hit “Publish”, add your comments and “Continue” <br>      ![Create Rule](/PublishingImages/create-rule17.jpg)
13. Test on a browser you aren’t logged in. 
Tip: In Chrome, select “New Incognito Window” <br>      ![Create Rule](/PublishingImages/create-rule18.jpg)
14. Check on the summary page (e.g. http://rules.ssw.com.au/RulesToBetterSomething/ ) if the order is correct 
If not it’s not correct, you can change the order of rules by following the instructions as per the section below:
![Create Rule](/PublishingImages/create-rule19.jpg)**​Tip: **You might need to refresh the cache – See “Rule Cache Management” also on the section above.​


Congratulations, you’ve just added a rule!

To increase traction in the community you should now tweet and Facebook it.
