 This is how you create a rule at **rules.ssw.com.au**. 
1. Log in to <br>      [http://rules.ssw.com.au/admin/Pages/default.aspx​](/admin/Pages/default.aspx)
2. Go to the category index. E.g For “Communication” go to http://rules.ssw.com.au/Communicatio​n/Pages/default.aspx
3. Then to the subcategory E.g. http://rules.ssw.com.au/Communication/RulesToBetterSomething​
4. Click on “Add a page” <br>      <dl class="image"><dt> 
            <img alt="Create Rule" src="/Communication/Rules-to-Better-Adding-Rules/PublishingImages/create-rule1.jpg"> 
         </dt></dl>    Note: Each rule will be a “page” on SharePoint – with its own URL - differently from old aspx, where rules where sections on a single page.
5. ​Add the URL <br>      <dl class="image"><dt> 
            <img alt="Create Rule" src="/Communication/Rules-to-Better-Adding-Rules/PublishingImages/create-rule2.jpg"> 
         </dt></dl>    Note: We use only the most important words of a rule title. The words in           **purple** are typically not used.
    E.g. #1 “**HTML/CSS - Do you know how to create spaces in a web page?**” should be “http://rules.ssw.com.au/WebSites/RulesToBetterWebsitesLayout/Pages/How-to-create-spaces-in-a-web-page.aspx”
    E.g. #2 “**Do you​ use "list" tags for lists only?**” should be “http://rules.ssw.com.au/WebSites/RulesToBetterWebsitesLayout/Pages/Use-list-tags-for-lists-only.aspx”
6. ​​Add the rule title <br>      <dl class="image"><dt> 
            <img alt="Create Rule" src="/Communication/Rules-to-Better-Adding-Rules/PublishingImages/create-rule3.jpg"> 
         </dt></dl>
7. ​​**IMPORTANT** – Adding rule intro + content <br>          You have three options:

    1. ​​**Option 1** – Start from scratch - Write content down on the fields
    2. ​​**Option 2** - Paste the content from another place - a HTML page on the browser or a Word document  <br>                    Warning: Select the “Paste Plaintext” when pasting or you will have a lot of work later
<dl class="goodImage"><dt>
                  <img alt="Create Rule" src="/Communication/Rules-to-Better-Adding-Rules/PublishingImages/create-rule4.jpg">
               </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - If you don’t select this, SharePoint will generate a lot of inline styling, which will cause triple work to fix.</dd></dl><dl class="badImage"><dt>
                  <img alt="Create Rule" src="/Communication/Rules-to-Better-Adding-Rules/PublishingImages/create-rule5.jpg">
               </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Terrible example of a HTML generated by pasting normally – not plaintext. All the margins, font family, external images aren’t necessary</dd></dl>        Since you have pasted the plain text, you’ll need to manually add the styling - headings, links, captions etc.
<dl class="image"><dt>
                  <img alt="Create Rule" src="/Communication/Rules-to-Better-Adding-Rules/PublishingImages/create-rule6.jpg">
               </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Add the styles. In SharePoint is very similar to Microsoft Word. The custom styles will have pretty much everything you'll need without having to touch the HTML code​</dd></dl>
    3. **Option 3**- Paste the HTML code (recommended if you already have the content in the internet and the HTML is neat enough)
        1. Open up and copy the HTML code (from “view source” on a browser)
        2. Go back to SharePoint (where you are adding the rule)
        3. Click in the field you are going to edit
        4. In the “Format Text” ribbon, click “Edit Source” <br>                  <dl class="image"><dt>
                        <img alt="Create Rule" src="/Communication/Rules-to-Better-Adding-Rules/PublishingImages/create-rule7.jpg">
                     </dt></dl>
        5. Paste the HTML there <br>                  <dl class="image"><dt>
                        <img alt="Create Rule" src="/Communication/Rules-to-Better-Adding-Rules/PublishingImages/create-rule8.jpg">
                     </dt></dl>
        6. Now fix up the images – This part is a bit painful
            - ​Firstly you will need to save all the images to your local drive
            - We don’t use the "Insert &gt; Picture" on the ribbon because it doesn’t generate the HTML code we use as default as per <br>                        [Do you use the righ​t HTML/CSS code to add the useful figure/caption?​](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulestoBetterWebsiteslayout.aspx#AddFigureWithRightCode)
            - Instead, u​pload them to the Images folder of e​ach rule subcategory - E.g. <br>                        http://rules.ssw.com.au/Communication/RulesToBetterSomething/PublishingImages/
                - Go to “Site Contents” <br>                              <dl class="image"><dt>
                                    <img alt="Create Rule" src="/Communication/Rules-to-Better-Adding-Rules/PublishingImages/create-rule9.jpg">
                                 </dt></dl>
                - Click on “Images” <br>                              <dl class="image"><dt>
                                    <img alt="Create Rule" src="/Communication/Rules-to-Better-Adding-Rules/PublishingImages/create-rule10.jpg">
                                 </dt></dl>
                - Drag the images from your local drive to the Images folder in SharePoint: <br>                              <dl class="image"><dt>
                                    <img alt="Create Rule" src="/Communication/Rules-to-Better-Adding-Rules/PublishingImages/create-rule11.jpg">
                                 </dt></dl>
                - Make sure you “Check In” all the images (otherwise they won’t be visible for anonymous users) <br>                              <dl class="image"><dt>
                                    <img alt="Create Rule" src="/Communication/Rules-to-Better-Adding-Rules/PublishingImages/create-rule12.jpg">
                                 </dt></dl>
                - On the screen above you can see the path for each image. Copy it so you can paste into the HTML.
 E.g. &lt;img src=”http://rules.ssw.com.au/Communication/RulesToBetterBlogging/PublishingImages/RulesBloggingAcknowledgeBad.jpg"&gt;
        7. ​​Double check the links – you might have got a relative link E.g. <br>                  **&lt;a href=”../company/Offices.aspx”&gt; **which will not work because it’s now on a different site.
 So you will need to make it absolute E.g. ​ <br>                  **&lt;a href=”**[**http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/company/Offices.aspx**](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/)**”&gt;**
8. ​Add the rule intro <br>          Try to have a catch at the end so the user will want to read the rest of the rule. E.g. “​To reply to a bug effectively and efficiently in your emails, you need to include:”
<dl class="image"><dt>
            <img alt="Create Rule" src="/Communication/Rules-to-Better-Adding-Rules/PublishingImages/create-rule13.jpg">
         </dt></dl><dl class="image"><dt> 
            <img alt="Create Rule" src="/Communication/Rules-to-Better-Adding-Rules/PublishingImages/create-rule14.jpg"> 
         </dt><dd>Figure&#58; The “Brief Blurb” should clearly explain what the rule is about and have a catch at the end</dd></dl>
9. Add the rule content <br>      <dl class="image"><dt>
            <img alt="Create Rule" src="/Communication/Rules-to-Better-Adding-Rules/PublishingImages/create-rule15.jpg">
         </dt></dl>
10. Add the acknowledgements <br>      <dl class="image"><dt>
            <img alt="Create Rule" src="/Communication/Rules-to-Better-Adding-Rules/PublishingImages/create-rule16.jpg">
         </dt></dl>
11. Hit “Publish” and “Continue” <br>      <dl class="image"><dt>
            <img alt="Create Rule" src="/Communication/Rules-to-Better-Adding-Rules/PublishingImages/create-rule17.jpg">
         </dt></dl>
12. Test on a browser you aren’t logged in. 
 Tip: In Chrome, select “New Incognito Window” <br>      <dl class="image"><dt>
            <img alt="Create Rule" src="/Communication/Rules-to-Better-Adding-Rules/PublishingImages/create-rule18.jpg">
         </dt></dl>
13. Check on the subcategory page (e.g. <br>      http://rules.ssw.com.au/Communication/RulesToBetterSomething/ ) if the order is correct <br>      
If not it’s not correct, you can change the order of rules ​​​by following the instructions below <br>      
Tip: You might need to refresh the cache – See “Rule Cache Management” <br>      <dl class="image"><dt>
            <img alt="Create Rule" src="/Communication/Rules-to-Better-Adding-Rules/PublishingImages/create-rule19.jpg">
         </dt></dl>
