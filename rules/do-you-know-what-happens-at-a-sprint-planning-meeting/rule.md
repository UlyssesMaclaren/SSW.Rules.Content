 This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field).   For each story The Team self-organises to decide HOW to implement it.  They create tasks, with sub-tasks whre necessary, for everything that needs to be done to implement the story.  Every task and sub-task should be given an estimate in hours and the same value placed in the Remaining field.

 No actual work on the Sprint should start until this planning is complete.  It is these Remaining hours that determine the first  value in the burndown chart which sets the Sprint on its way to ceompletion.  There must be no omissions or The Team will start without an accurate burndown and we all know that "The Team is nothing without a burndown".

 The Team should also ensure that the burndown chart is working and will be automatically sent to all members of The Scrum Team overnight.  

 The meeting concludes when The Team reports to the ScrumMaster that their planning is complete and they are able to display the burndown chart.

 Ideally this meeting is timeboxed to as may hours as there will be weeks in the Sprint.  However, this planning is so essentail that it must continue to completion outside the meeeting if necessary. 

 It is not essentail for the Product Owner or the Scrum Master to be present for the whole meeting but they must be available for consultation.  The ScrumMastershould fromally close the meeting.
