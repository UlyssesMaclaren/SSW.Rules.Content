Communication and how you express yourself to your co-workers and clients is reflective                     of the company you work for. You should practice correct English,                     as it displays your professionalism and courtesy.

​For example:
 "It's going good"                         Bad Example - using incorrect English"It's going well"Good Example - using correct English
