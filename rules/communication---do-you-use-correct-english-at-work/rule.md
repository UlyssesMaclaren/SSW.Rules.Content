Communication and how you express yourself to your co-workers and clients is reflective                     of the company you work for. At SSW, we find it beneficial to practice correct English,                     as it displays our professionalism and courtesy. For example:
 "It's going good"                         Bad Example - using incorrect English"It's going well"Good Example - using correct English
