​When a colleague or a Client asks you to do a task verbally, or you have discovered there’s a task you need to do but don’t have time to do it then and there, ​what method do you have for remembering to do it?

The best solution is to send yourself an email CC'ing the person that asked you to do the task saying "[As per our conversation](/Pages/DoYouAlwaysSendAnAsPerOurConversationEmail.aspx)..​." This way both of you know that the job needs to be done. Writing yourself a "Post-It Note" is not the best method. This is really important especially when you are working for clients so there is a record of the requests for work.
 
Always add "To myself" in the email body - not on the subject - so that other people CC'd know what is going on.

**To myself,**
as per my conversation with Lei, the rule on progress bar is missing a bad example

1. Add bad example to Rules to Better UI - progress bar - https://rules.ssw.com.au/long-process-do-you-show-the-status-of-progress-bar-on-winforms-title

Figure: Good Example - Send yourself an email, and make it clear to everyone else
