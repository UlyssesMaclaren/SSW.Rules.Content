<span class='intro'> <p>Always make links perfectly clear.</p> </span>

<p> It's very important that your links stand out from the background as well as the surrounding text. A solid underline and a contrasting colour is the usually the best choice, but the exact method is not important as long as the end result stands out. A link should not only be discoverable upon accidental hovering. </p><p> Rollovers are important as they offer visual feedback to a user that this link that will take them somewhere. While there are a myriad of ways to do this; you can't go wrong with a simple text colour change. </p>
