 SQL Compare is a good tool to find out the differences between two databases. It can help you answer the question "Is your database the same as mine?". 

<br>Let's see what it is good at. <br> ![](SQLCompareSync.png) Figure: You can use SQL Compare to make two databases the same ![](SQLCompareTables.png) Figure: SQL Compare clearly shows some tables are missing 
So if you want to compare 2 databases SQL Compare (or Data Dudes Compare) is great tools. They even let you synchronize sweetly between these 2 databases. However, if you are doing this at the end of your release cycle, you have a problem.  Your schema deployment process is broken.

What you should be doing is seeing your [Schema Master](/Pages/DoYouHaveASchemaMaster.aspx "Database Schema Master") each time you have a new .sql file. You do this during the development process, not at the end in the package and deployment process.
![](SQLScriptInTFS.png) Figure: Give your SQL scripts to 'Schema Master' who will, check them into TFS, then run them Note: We have a tool called [SQL Deploy](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/SQLDeploy/) to help with automatic deployment.
