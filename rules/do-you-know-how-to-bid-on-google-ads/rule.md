Your focus when bidding is dependent on your campaign goal.

​​​​Focus points to consider:
 
- **Clicks** – if you want people to visit your website
- **Impressions** – if you’re looking into increasing brand visibility
- **Conversions** – if you’d like a specific action on your website (e.g sale!)
- **Views** – consider it for videos only
- **Engagements** – looking for interactions with your ad? Clicks or calls would be the right answer (general clicks, calls, ask for directions, etc)​​
