Every email you process takes time. Sifting through unnecessary emails becomes really frustrating. Don't clog up someone else's Inbox with unnecessary emails.

A good rule of thumb for whether an email is unnecessary is if your email comprises of less than 5 words (e.g. "Thanks!" or "Well Done") it's likely it doesn't need to be sent.
