For a smooth and responsive user experience, your site needs to be checked for performance bottlenecks. These usually become noticeable sometime after deployment, as your user base and quantity of content grows.

This includes:
 
- Check for and improve the slowest pages
- Check for and improve the compression of unnecessarily large images
- Check for and improve inefficient Ajax JavaScript code
- Check for and improve the slowest database queries
- Check for and improve page responsiveness
